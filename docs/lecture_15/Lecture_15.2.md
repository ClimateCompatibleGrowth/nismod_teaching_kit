## Short description

This mini-lecture introduces the concept of 'ecosystem services' and
considers how these services link to the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDG) targets. The mini-lecture shows how different ecosystems (forests
and non-forests) can directly and indirectly influence SDG targets, and
introduces a framework to help decision-makers understand the ways in
which nature-based solutions (NbS) can influence development outcomes.

## Learning objectives

-   Describe the concept of ecosystem services and give examples of the
    multiple ways in which nature can influence the targets of the SDGs

-   Differentiate between direct and indirect influences of nature on
    the SDGs and recall examples

-   Recall how nature may provide substitutable, unique or complementary
    influences.

## Introducing the concept of ecosystem services

Natural and semi-natural ecosystems, including grasslands, forests,
wetlands, dune systems and reefs, provide ecosystem services which
support positive societal, environmental and economic outcomes
[@Fuldauer2021; @Blicharska2019]. Through the delivery of these
services, ecosystems underpin the functioning and well-being of
societies, the economy and the environment [@Kapos2019;
@Faivre2017]. As such, the management of ecosystems can contribute to,
or undermine, progress on the United Nations' Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) [@Wood2018; @Dasgupta2020; @Seddon2021].

In order to understand how ecosystems can be leveraged to support the
achievement of the SDGs and SDG targets, it necessitates an
understanding of what services different ecosystems can provide.

A number of classifications of ecosystem services have been developed.
These include TEEB (The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity), MEA
(Millennium Ecosystem Assessment), CICES (The Common International
Classification of Ecosystem Services) and IPBES (Intergovernmental
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services).
Ecosystem services are typically classified according to four
categories: provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural (see Table
15.2.1).

**Table 15.2.1:** Examples of ecosystem services

  Category       Ecosystem Service Examples
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Provisioning   Food, freshwater, habitat, medicinal resources, timber
  Regulating     Purification of water and maintenance of water quality, regulation of air quality, pest and disease control, nutrient cycling, waste recycling, wave dissipation, buffering against extreme events, pollination, provision of firebreaks, climate regulation, maintenance of ecological stability, sediment storage and transport, purification of the environment, stabilisation of sediments and regulation of soil erosion, filtering of contaminants, regulation of water flows, carbon sequestration, protective services
  Supporting     Biodiversity, soil formation, primary production
  Cultural       Cultural and natural heritage, recreation, intellectual and inspirational activities, ecotourism, traditional lifestyles, health and well-being, green space, value for scientific research, aesthetic value/scenic beauty, spiritual appreciation, preservation of traditional lifestyles, educational resources, passive use value

It is important to note that different ecosystems can provide the same
service. For example, although forests have received attention for
carbon sequestration, peatlands and coastal ecosystems (e.g. mangroves,
seagrass) also provide carbon sequestration services. Equally, flood
mitigation can be provided by multiple ecosystems, such as inland and
coastal wetlands, as well as forests. Understanding this will be
important for later on in the course, when we consider how ecosystems
can be integrated into infrastructure systems and climate adaptation.

## Nature underpinning the SDGs

In 2015, the United Nations established the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development with the aim of eradicating extreme poverty, reducing
inequality and protecting the planet [@UN2015]. The 2030 Agenda
highlights the importance of biodiversity and the functioning of
ecosystems to maintain economic activities and societal well-being. For
example, within the preamble, nations commit to "*protect the planet
from degradation, including through sustainable consumption and
production, sustainably managing its natural resources and taking urgent
action on climate change, so that it can support the needs of the
present and future generations*".

**Figure 15.2.2:** Nature-based solutions underpin all the Sustainable
Development Goals [@WWF2020]

The SDGs explicitly make reference to ecosystems in SDG 14 ('life below
water') and SDG 15 ('life on land'), which contain specific targets
aimed to reduce threats to biodiversity, protect ecosystem functions,
and support the flows of services to people
[@LivingPlanetReport2018].

However, different ecosystems can contribute to the achievement of a
wider range of SDGs and related targets by providing ecosystem services
which generate various additional social, economic and environmental
benefits [@WWAP2018]. For example, the FAO [@FAO2014] reports that
1.6 billion people, including 60 million indigenous people, directly
depend on natural ecosystems for their livelihoods. Equally, the 2020
World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Risk Report identified that the top
risks to society and the economy are related to environmental risks,
including biodiversity loss, water crises and climate impacts
[@WEF2020; @WWF2019].

**Figure 15.2.3:** Natural ecosystems, through the provision of
ecosystem services, underpin the three pillars of the Sustainable
Development Goals: societies, economies and the environment
[@LivingPlanetReport2018].

The extent to which nature can influence the SDGs can be understood
through analysis of nature's influence on the SDG targets.

## Achieving the SDGs through ecosystem services

Building upon the research outlined in mini-lecture 1.3, which explored
the potential for engineered infrastructure sectors to influence the SDG
targets, a study by @Fuldauer2021 has developed a framework for
understanding the potential for different natural and semi-natural
ecosystems to influence the SDG targets:

-   *Direct influences*: Identified where an ecosystem service (as
    described in the relevant ecosystem service classification), is
    directly mentioned or described in the SDG target, following the
    definition of @Thacker2019. For example, target 11.6 *"By 2030,
    reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities,
    including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal
    and other waste management"* is directly influenced by the
    'purification of air' services provided by ecosystems.  

-   *Indirect influences:* Identified where an ecosystem service is not
    described specifically in the target, but where evidence
    demonstrates that increasing the quantity or quality of the service
    can enhance achievement of the target. For example, target 4.1 *"By
    2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and
    quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and
    effective learning outcomes"* can be indirectly influenced
    by nature, as there is evidence that improving the quality or
    quantity of nature's freshwater supply, as well as its climate
    adaptation services that reduce the urban heat effect, can improve
    school attendance and educational outcomes [@Blicharska2019] and
    thereby support achievement of the target. 

Through implementing NbS, and restoring, protecting, sustainably
managing or creating new ecosystems, practitioners can enhance the
quality or quantity of ecosystem services provided in order to help
progress the SDGs.

## A closer look at the potential for nature to influence the SDGs

@Fuldauer2021 undertook a systematic analysis and found that natural
environments directly influence 40 out of the 169 SDG targets (25%)
across 14 of the 17 SDG goals. This pervasive role is attributed to the
diversity of ecosystem services that natural environments provide,
including the provisioning of food, water, protective services,
purification of the environment, recreation and heritage services.

**Figure 15.2.5:** Natural environments were found to directly
contribute to 63% of targets under SDG 6 ('clean water'), 60% of targets
under SDG 11 ('sustainable cities'), 50% of targets under SDG 2 ('zero
hunger') and to targets under six further SDGs [@Fuldauer2021].

**Figure 15.2.6:** Natural ecosystems are only explicitly referenced
under SDG 14 and SDG 15, and directly underpin 40% and 42% of targets
under each, respectively [@Fuldauer2021].

Beyond SDG 14 and 15, nature directly influences targets under 12
different SDGs, which implies that projects that leverage nature can
have much wider influence on the SDGs.

The study found that ecosystems indirectly influence 67 SDG targets
across all 17 SDGs. Awareness of indirect SDG influences is critical for
decision-makers to leverage nature for positive social, environmental
and economic outcomes to deliver more broadly on the SDGs.

Natural sectors can also provide services which are globally
non-substitutable by built infrastructure in safeguarding well-being --
for example, ecosystems provide air purification as well as natural
heritage services that are globally non-substitutable in their
contributions to targets under SDG 11.

**Figure 15.2.7:** The framework developed by @Fuldauer2021 shows the
potential for different natural ecosystems to influence the SDGs. This
framework will be introduced and used in Hands-on 9.

However, the tendency for nature to be highly context-specific suggests
that in practice, ecological suitability of different ecosystems to
deliver an ecosystem service will vary, and their potential to provide
positive influences on the SDG targets will also vary, and likely
involve trade-offs with other targets. The case of eucalyptus forest
implementation is a widely cited example of where natural ecosystems can
lead to unintended negative consequences, and thus potentially undermine
achievement of the SDGs (see Figure 15.2.8).

consideration of local context, eucalyptus can lead to increased
prevalence of fires and dangerous drops in the water table, which could
lead to dire consequences if implemented in drought-stricken regions

## Using the 'nature-SDG' tool for exploring influences

The study undertaken by @Fuldauer2021 has provided a granular
identification of the links between nature and the SDGs. The tool
developed throughout the study can be used as a framework to understand
the potential of ecosystems in progressing the SDGs. A step-by-step
walkthrough of the tool is available in Hands-on 9.

Within the tool, practitioners are able to compare the ways in which
nature can be leveraged to influence SDG targets. SDG targets are
described in terms of a single sector's service only (unique influence),
multiple sectors' services (cross-sectoral) or services that can be
substituted by a different sector (substitutable). By understanding
where multiple ecosystems can provide the same service (substitute),
decision-makers have a choice of how to progress on target achievement.
For example, water ecosystems, forests and wetlands provide services
that are substitutable in achieving 10%, 8% and 8% of all SDG targets,
respectively. It is useful to understand the degree to which services
can be provided by different ecosystems, given the large focus on
forests and the need to protect native ecosystems.

The tool enables decision-makers to compare SDG influences between
ecosystems and the built environment (e.g. energy, water). When
comparing ecosystem and built environments, 12% of all SDG targets can
be progressed by services provided by either built or natural
infrastructure sectors. This provides a foundation for understanding the
potential for nature to substitute or complement services provided by
engineered infrastructure, which will be important for when we explore
how NbS can be integrated into built infrastructure sectors for
progressing on the SDGs.

## 

## Summary 

Nature directly or indirectly underpins all SDGs through the provision
of ecosystem services. Understanding the types of influences of nature
on the SDG targets can help decision-makers identify how best to
leverage nature to progress the SDGs. The 'nature-SDG' tool can be used
to explore potential influences. Given the tendency of nature to be
context-specific, it is important to note that the framework analyses
*potential* ecosystem services and *potential* influences on SDG
targets. The ability of a particular ecosystem to deliver the service
and progress any SDG target is dependent upon the wider landscape and
local context (see Lecture 18).
