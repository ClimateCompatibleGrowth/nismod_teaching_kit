@article{Deemer2016,
	abstract = {Collectively, reservoirs created by dams are thought to be an important source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere. So far, efforts to quantify, model, and manage these emissions have been limited by data availability and inconsistencies in methodological approach. Here, we synthesize reservoir CH4, CO2, and N2O emission data with three main objectives: (1) to generate a global estimate of GHG emissions from reservoirs, (2) to identify the best predictors of these emissions, and (3) to consider the effect of methodology on emission estimates. We estimate that GHG emissions from reservoir water surfaces account for 0.8 (0.5-1.2) Pg CO2 equivalents per year, with the majority of this forcing due to CH4. We then discuss the potential for several alternative pathways such as dam degassing and downstream emissions to contribute significantly to overall emissions. Although prior studies have linked reservoir GHG emissions to reservoir age and latitude, we find that factors related to reservoir productivity are better predictors of emission.},

@book{UnitedNations2020,
	abstract = {For over a decade, the UNEP Emissions Gap Report has provided a yearly review of the difference between where greenhouse emissions are predicted to be in 2030 and where they should be to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The report finds that, despite a brief dip in carbon dioxide emissions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is still heading for a temperature rise in excess of 3$\,^{\circ}$C this century -- far beyond the Paris Agreement goals of limiting global warming to well below 2$\,^{\circ}$C and pursuing 1.5$\,^{\circ}$C. However, a low-carbon pandemic recovery could cut 25 per cent off the greenhouse emissions expected in 2030, based on policies in place before COVID-19. Such a recovery would far outstrip savings foreseen with the implementation of unconditional Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, and put the world close to the 2$\,^{\circ}$C pathway. The report also analyses low-carbon recovery measures so far, summarizes the scale of new net-zero emissions pledges by nations and looks at the potential of the lifestyle, aviation and shipping sectors to bridge the gap.

@article{Wakeel2016,
	abstract = {Energy and water are essential, inseparable, and inextricably linked resources that are recognized as indispensable inputs to modern economic and national security. Understanding the nexus of energy and water may help minimize energy and water consumption and reduce environmental emissions. This paper presents a literature review of the current status, research gaps, dependence factors, and possible improvement measures to reduce energy consumption in the water sector. The energy use in the extraction, desalination, pumping, collection, and wastewater treatment stages of the water sector from a global perspective in various developed and developing countries is investigated. The results show that water supply and wastewater services are energy intensive globally owing to old infrastructures and technologies. Energy intensities in the water sector vary with technology, geographical distances, and demographic conditions. The methodologies for energy accounting for various water uses are also summarized. Finally, knowledge gaps, challenges and policy implications are identified by synthesizing previous research.},

	abstract = {This article presents estimations of the energy and carbon footprint of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Entertainment & Media (E & M) sectors globally for 2010-2015 including a forecast to 2020. It builds on three previous global studies (2007, 2011, and 2018) and a Swedish study (2015) by the same authors. The study is based on an extensive dataset which combines primary and secondary data for operational (use stage) energy consumption and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions (CO2e) for the included sub-sectors, including energy and carbon footprint data from about 100 of the major global manufacturers, operators, and ICT and E & M service providers. The data set also includes sales statistics and forecasts for equipment to estimate product volumes in addition to published LCA studies and primary manufacturing data to estimate the embodied carbon footprint of products. The result shows that the ICT and E & M sectors have turned their previously growing footprints into shrinking ones despite a continuous increase in subscriptions and data traffic. Furthermore, the results of this study are also indicating that these footprints are significantly smaller than previously forecasted.},

@article{Olivier2020,
	abstract = {In 2016, total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (excluding those from land use) continued to increase slowly by about 0.5% ($\pm$1%), to about 49.3 gigatonnes in CO2 equivalent (Gt CO2 eq). Taking into account that 2016 was a leap year, and therefore 0.3% longer, and together with the 0.2% increase in 2015, the 2016 emission increase was the slowest since the early 1990s, except for global recession years. This is mainly the result of lower coal consumption from fuel switches to natural gas and increased renewable power generation; in particular, in wind and solar power. Most of the emissions (about 72%) consist of CO2, but methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gases (so-called F-gases) also make up substantial shares (19%, 6% and 3%, respectively). These percentages do not include net emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), which are usually accounted for separately, because they are inherently very uncertain and show large interannual variations. When including LULUCF emissions --- for 2016 estimated at about 4.1 Gt CO2 eq --- estimated global total GHG emissions come to 53.4 Gt CO2 eq. The trend in global CO2 emissions excluding those from LULUCF has remained more or less flat, over the last two years ($\pm$0.5%). Non-CO2 greenhouse gases retained an annual growth rate of about 1%.},

Here we explore (dis)connections in evidence and governance between these commitments.

	abstract = {The aim of this dissertation is to determine how long-term infrastructure development can be fostered in line with the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. The research question has been directed towards the Small Island Developing State (SIDS) St. Lucia. Given their limited resources, it is particularly critical for SIDS such as St. Lucia to maximize co-benefits across sectors. The analysis conducted revealed that mitigation action in infrastructure systems has the potential to positively affect the entire SDG framework. The energy system was seen to have the most potential. Further, the mitigation strategies developed for the energy and waste systems in St. Lucia demonstrated that both supply and demand initiatives are needed for optimal low carbon development. Moreover, through stakeholder interviews it was revealed that critical barriers such as finance, politics, and lack of regulation and legislation need to be overcome to ensure the full and continual success of infrastructure-mitigation planning.},

@article{Thacker2019,
	abstract = {Infrastructure systems form the backbone of every society, providing essential services that include energy, water, waste management, transport and telecommunications. Infrastructure can also create harmful social and environmental impacts, increase vulnerability to natural disasters and leave an unsustainable burden of debt. Investment in infrastructure is at an all-time high globally, thus an ever-increasing number of decisions are being made now that will lock-in patterns of development for future generations. Although for the most part these investments are motivated by the desire to increase economic productivity and employment, we find that infrastructure either directly or indirectly influences the attainment of all of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including 72% of the targets. We categorize the positive and negative effects of infrastructure and the interdependencies between infrastructure sectors. To ensure that the right infrastructure is built, policymakers need to establish long-term visions for sustainable national infrastructure systems, informed by the SDGs, and develop adaptable plans that can demonstrably deliver their vision.},

Using network analysis techniques, we show that some thematic areas covered by the SDGs are well connected among one another. Other parts of the network have weaker connec-tions with the rest of the system. The SDGs as a whole are a more integrated system than the MDGs were, which may facilitate policy integration across sectors. However, many of the links among goals that have been documented in biophysical, economic and social dimensions are not explicitly reflected in the SDGs. Beyond the added visibility that the SDGs provide to links among thematic areas, attempts at policy integration across various areas will have to be based on studies of the biophysical, social and economic systems.
