	abstract = {UNOPS and ITRC-MISTRAL presented the results of the EBI assessment at the Resilient Infrastructure Conference in Curacao, on the 8th and 9th of May, 2018. More than 100 participants attended from Curacao, the Caribbean region and international institutions. Key stakeholders in attendance from Curacao included the Prime Minister, 3 Ministers, ministry representatives, public utility companies, the University, private sector, donors and NGOs. Regional representation came from St Lucia, Grenada, Antigua, Dominica, Barbados and Belize. Evidence Based Infrastructure UNOPS advocates the need for a paradigm shift in infrastructure planning: moving away from traditional silo-based practices, towards a holistic approach that recognizes the interdependence of infrastructure systems across cities, countries and regions. In order to do so, UNOPS has developed the Evidence Based Infrastructure (EBI) framework, to support countries in making evidence-based decisions for a more resilient infrastructure with regards to future challenges such as climate change.},

	abstract = {This article presents estimations of the energy and carbon footprint of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Entertainment & Media (E & M) sectors globally for 2010-2015 including a forecast to 2020. It builds on three previous global studies (2007, 2011, and 2018) and a Swedish study (2015) by the same authors. The study is based on an extensive dataset which combines primary and secondary data for operational (use stage) energy consumption and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions (CO2e) for the included sub-sectors, including energy and carbon footprint data from about 100 of the major global manufacturers, operators, and ICT and E & M service providers. The data set also includes sales statistics and forecasts for equipment to estimate product volumes in addition to published LCA studies and primary manufacturing data to estimate the embodied carbon footprint of products. The result shows that the ICT and E & M sectors have turned their previously growing footprints into shrinking ones despite a continuous increase in subscriptions and data traffic. Furthermore, the results of this study are also indicating that these footprints are significantly smaller than previously forecasted.},

	abstract = {The aim of this dissertation is to determine how long-term infrastructure development can be fostered in line with the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. The research question has been directed towards the Small Island Developing State (SIDS) St. Lucia. Given their limited resources, it is particularly critical for SIDS such as St. Lucia to maximize co-benefits across sectors. The analysis conducted revealed that mitigation action in infrastructure systems has the potential to positively affect the entire SDG framework. The energy system was seen to have the most potential. Further, the mitigation strategies developed for the energy and waste systems in St. Lucia demonstrated that both supply and demand initiatives are needed for optimal low carbon development. Moreover, through stakeholder interviews it was revealed that critical barriers such as finance, politics, and lack of regulation and legislation need to be overcome to ensure the full and continual success of infrastructure-mitigation planning.},
