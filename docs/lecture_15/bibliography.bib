abstract = {Better stewardship of land is needed to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement goal of holding warming to below 2 °C; however, confusion persists about the specific set of land stewardship options available and their mitigation potential. To address this, we identify and quantify “natural climate solutions” (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find that the maximum potential of NCS—when constrained by food security, fiber security, and biodiversity conservation—is 23.8 petagrams of CO2 equivalent (PgCO2e) y−1 (95{\%} CI 20.3–37.4). This is ≥30{\%} higher than prior estimates, which did not include the full range of options and safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3 PgCO2e y−1) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assuming the social cost of CO2 pollution is ≥100 USD MgCO2e−1 by 2030. Natural climate solutions can provide 37{\%} of cost-effective CO2 mitigation needed through 2030 for a {\textgreater}66{\%} chance of holding warming to below 2 °C. One-third of this cost-effective NCS mitigation can be delivered at or below 10 USD MgCO2−1. Most NCS actions—if effectively implemented—also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience. Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of NCS mitigation estimates. Nevertheless, existing knowledge reported here provides a robust basis for immediate global action to improve ecosystem stewardship as a major solution to climate change.},

abstract = {The forestry sector can not only sustain its carbon but also has the potential to absorb carbon from the atmosphere. India has maintained approximately 64 Mha of forest cover for the last decade. The rate of afforestation in India is one of the highest among the tropical countries, currently estimated to be 2 Mha per annum. The annual productivity has increased from 0.7 m3 per hectare in 1985 to 1.37 m3 per hectare in 1995. Increase in annual productivity directly indicates an increase in forest biomass and hence higher carbon sequestration potential. The carbon pool for the Indian forests is estimated to be 2026.72 Mt for the year 1995. Estimates of annual carbon uptake increment suggest that our forests and plantations have been able to remove at least 0.125 Gt of CO2 from the atmosphere in the year 1995. Assuming that the present forest cover in India will sustain itself with a marginal annual increase by 0.5 Mha in area of plantations, we can expect our forests to continue to act as a net carbon sink in future.},

abstract = {In this paper, we reflect on the implications for science, policy and practice of the recently introduced concept of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS), with a focus on the European context. First, we analyse NBS in relation to similar concepts, and reflect on its relationship to sustainability as an overarching framework. From this, we derive a set of questions to be addressed and propose a general framework for how these might be addressed in NBS projects by funders, researchers, policy-makers and practitioners. We conclude that: (1) NBS need to be developed and discussed in relation to existing concepts to clarify their added value;(2) When considering and implementing NBS, the ‘relabelling' of related concepts and the misuse of the concept have to be prevented in order to avoid misunderstanding, duplication and unintended consequences;(3) NBS as currently framed by the European Commission provides an opportunity for: a) transdisciplinary research into the design and implementation of solutions based on nature; and b) overcoming a bias towards development alternatives with narrow perspectives that focus on short-term economic gains and effectiveness;(4) The strength of the NBS concept is its integrative, systemic approach which prevents it from becoming just another “green communication tool” that provides justification for a classical model of natural resource exploitation and management measures.To realise their full potential, NBS must be developed by including the experience of all relevant stakeholders such that ‘solutions' contribute to achieving all dimensions of sustainability. As NBS are developed, we must also moderate the expectations placed on them since the precedent provided by other initiatives whose aim was to manage nature sustainably demonstrates that we should not expect NBS to be cheap and easy, at least not in the short-term.},

Excluding existing trees and agricultural and urban areas, we found that there is room for an extra 0.9 billion hectares of canopy cover, which could store 205 gigatonnes of carbon in areas that would naturally support woodlands and forests. This highlights global tree restoration as our most effective climate change solution to date. However, climate change will alter this potential tree coverage.We estimate that if we cannot deviate from the current trajectory, the global potential canopy cover may shrink by {\~{}}223 million hectares by 2050, with the vast majority of losses occurring in the tropics. Our results highlight the opportunity of climate change mitigation through global tree restoration but also the urgent need for action.},

abstract = {Despite substantial increases in the scope and magnitude of biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration, there remains ongoing degradation of natural resources that adversely affects both biodiversity and human well-being. Nature-based Solutions (NbS) can be an effective framework for reversing this trend, by increasing the alignment between conservation and sustainable development objectives. However, unless there is clarity on its evolution, definition and principles, and relationship with related approaches, it will not be possible to develop evidence-based standards and guidelines, or to implement, assess, improve and upscale NbS interventions globally. In order to address this gap, we present the definition and principles underpinning the NbS framework, recently adopted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and compare it to (1) the Ecosystem Approach that was the foundation for developing the NbS definitional framework, and (2) four specific ecosystem-based approaches (Forest Landscape Restoration, Ecosystem-based Adaptation, Ecological Restoration and Protected Areas) that can be considered as falling under the NbS framework. Although we found substantial alignment between NbS principles and the principles of the other frameworks, three of the eight NbS principles stand out from other approaches: NbS can be implemented alone or in an integrated manner with other solutions; NbS should be applied at a landscape scale; and, NbS are integral to the overall design of policies, measures and actions, to address societal challenges. Reversely, concepts such as adaptive management/governance, effectiveness, uncertainty, multi-stakeholder participation, and temporal scale are present in other frameworks but not captured at all or detailed enough in the NbS principles. This critical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the NbS principles can inform the review and revision of principles supporting specific types of NbS (such as the approaches reviewed here), as well as serve as the foundation for the development of standards for the successful implementation of NbS.},

abstract = {There is growing awareness that 'nature-based solutions' (NbS) can help to protect us from climate change impacts while slowing further warming, supporting biodiversity and securing ecosystem services. However, the potential of NbS to provide the intended benefits has not been rigorously assessed. There are concerns over their reliability and cost-effectiveness compared to engineered alternatives, and their resilience to climate change. Trade-offs can arise if climate mitigation policy encourages NbS with low biodiversity value, such as afforestation with non-native monocultures. This can result in maladaptation, especially in a rapidly changing world where biodiversity-based resilience and multi-functional landscapes are key. Here, we highlight the rise of NbS in climate policy-focusing on their potential for climate change adaptation as well as mitigation-and discuss barriers to their evidence-based implementation. We outline the major financial and governance challenges to implementing NbS at scale, highlighting avenues for further research. As climate policy turns increasingly towards greenhouse gas removal approaches such as afforestation, we stress the urgent need for natural and social scientists to engage with policy makers. They must ensure that NbS can achieve their potential to tackle both the climate and biodiversity crisis while also contributing to sustainable development. This will require systemic change in the way we conduct research and run our institutions.},

We believe that integrating ecosystem services, the benefits nature provides to people, into strategies for meeting the SDGs can help achieve this. Many development goals are likely underpinned by the delivery of one or more ecosystem services. Understanding how these services could support multiple development targets will be essential for planning synergistic and cost-effective interventions. Here we present the results of an expert survey on the contributions of 16 ecosystem services to achieving SDG targets linked to environment and human well-being, and review the capacity of modelling tools to evaluate SDG-relevant ecosystem services interactions. Survey respondents judged that individual ecosystem services could make important contributions to achieving 41 targets across 12 SDGs. The provision of food and water, habitat {\&} biodiversity maintenance, and carbon storage {\&} sequestration were perceived to each make contributions to {\textgreater}14 SDG targets, suggesting cross-target interactions are likely, and may present opportunities for synergistic outcomes across multiple SDGs. Existing modelling tools are well-aligned to support SDG-relevant ecosystem service planning. Together, this work identifies entry points and tools to further analyze the role of ecosystem services to support the SDGs.},

If we continue along this path, we jeopardise further progress and a secure future for coming generations, especially for those being left behind. We must urgently make a just transition to a net carbon-neutral society and halt and reverse nature loss, including through green and blue finance and shifting to clean energy and environmentally friendly food production. By scaling up the use of nature-based solutions to climate, food, land and development challenges, we can forge an integrated approach to climate, nature and sustainable development. Sustainably managing, protecting and restoring natural habitats and ecosystems provides important benefits for people's livelihoods, wellbeing and inclusion, and can accelerate progress on the SDGs. Our planet's natural systems are collapsing, and this is having a direct impact on human life and wellbeing. More and more people are coming to realise that our disregard of the environment in public and private decision-making has been, and continues to be, a grievous mistake. People are taking to the streets in protest against inaction on climate change and nature loss. Private sector recognition of the problems is also on the increase: extreme weather, climate policy failure and natural disasters are the top three global risks for 2019 identified by the World Economic Forum. Water shortages, biodiversity loss and large-scale displacement of people also rank in the top 10. The concerns are well founded: each year more than seven million people die prematurely from air pollution, which includes 600,000 children (UN Human Rights 2019). In 2012, more than 12.6 million people died from environmental causes, which represents nearly one quarter of all deaths worldwide that year (UN Environment 2019). Biodiversity-the variety of life at genetic, species and ecosystem levels-is essential to our food and agriculture, and it is in severe decline. Nearly a third of fish stocks are overfished and a third of freshwater fish species are threatened with extinction. Ecosystems that supply clean water, protect against hazards and provide habitat for species such as pollinators, are declining rapidly (FAO 2019). Biodiversity and functioning ecosystems cushion societies against catastrophes and they support recovery afterwards. With the degradation of ecosystems, these roles can now no longer be taken for granted.},

Any breathing space this offers to leaders should not be squandered: the urgency of facing up to systemic challenges has intensified over the past year amid proliferating signs of uncertainty, instability and fragility. This year's report covers more risks than ever, but focuses in particular on four key areas: environmental degradation, cybersecurity breaches, economic strains and geopolitical tensions. And in a new series called “Future Shocks” the report cautions against complacency and highlights the need to prepare for sudden and dramatic disruptions. The 2018 report also presents the results of our latest Global Risks Perception Survey, in which nearly 1,000 experts and decision-makers assess the likelihood and impact of 30 global risks over a 10-year horizon. Over this medium-term period, environmental and cyber risks predominate. However, the survey also highlights elevated levels of concern about risk trajectories in 2018, particularly in relation to geopolitical tensions.},

abstract = {Eucalyptus is the tree of choice for wood production by farmers in Ethiopia. Although there are many claims about its harmful effect on ecology and water availability, little actual research exists. The main objective of this study was, therefore, to study the extent of harm of Eucalyptus on the ecosystem. This study was conducted at the Koga Watershed near Lake Tana in Ethiopia. Twenty-five farmers were interviewed and a field experiment with three replications was carried out to quantify the effect of Eucalyptus on various soil physical and chemical properties and maize crop measurements and to compare bulk density, soil moisture contents, maize crop counts and shading effects in fields bordered by Eucalyptus and Croton macrostachyus. Our results show that Eucalyptus decreased both soil nutrients and maize yields within 20 m of the trees. Although moisture content was not affected during the monsoon, it decreased faster within 30 m of the Eucalyptus trees than elsewhere. Soils become water repellent, too. Local farmers' perception agreed with our experimental findings and indicated that Eucalyptus trees are exhausting the once productive land. They also reported that Eucalyptus dries up springs. Despite this, the growers insist on planting Eucalyptus because of its cash income.},

abstract = {Contemporary societies are facing a broad range of challenges, from pressures on human health and well-being to natural capital depletion, and the security of food, water and energy. These challenges are deeply intertwined with global processes, such as climate change and with local events such as natural disasters. The EU's research {\&} innovation (R{\&}I) policy is now seeking to address these challenges from a new perspective, with Nature-Based Solutions, and turn them into innovation opportunities that optimise the synergies between nature, society and the economy. Nature-Based Solutions can be an opportunity for innovation, and are here promoted by both policymakers and practitioners as a cost-effective way of creating a greener, more sustainable, and more competitive economy. Since 2013, the European Commission has devoted particular attention to Nature-Based Solutions through consultations and dialogues that sought to make the concept of these solutions more concrete and to define the concept's place within the spectrum of ecosystem-based approaches. In 2014, the Commission launched an expert group, which conducted further analysis, and made recommendations to help increase the use of Nature-Based Solutions and bring nature back into cities. In 2015, a survey was conducted on citizens' views and perceptions of 'Nature in Cities' to provide further insight for future work. Based on these elements and on results from running EU projects, the Commission has developed an R{\&}I agenda for Nature-Based Solutions and has published targeted calls for proposals for large-scale demonstration projects in this field in 2016 and 2017. Additional R{\&}I actions at EU level that promote systemic Nature-Based Solutions and their benefits to cities and territories are planned with the aim to improve the implementation capacity and evidence base for deploying Nature-Based Solutions and developing corresponding future markets. They are also expected to foster an interdisciplinary R{\&}I and stakeholder community and the exchange of good practices in this field, as well as help shaping and implementing international R{\&}I agendas on Nature-Based Solutions.},

This Review discusses the breadth of ways in which biodiversity can support sustainable development. It uses the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a basis for exploring scientific evidence of the benefits delivered by biodiversity. It focuses on papers that provide examples of how biodiversity components (that is, ecosystems, species and genes) directly deliver benefits that may contribute to the achievement of individual SDGs. It also considers how biodiversity's direct contributions to fulfilling some SDGs may indirectly support the achievement of other SDGs to which biodiversity does not contribute directly. How the attributes (for example, diversity, abundance or composition) of biodiversity components influence the benefits delivered is also presented, where described by the papers reviewed. While acknowledging potential negative impacts and trade-offs between different benefits, the study concludes that biodiversity may contribute to fulfilment of all SDGs.},

@article{LivingPlanetReport2018,
abstract = {In recent years, the global community has set clear targets for sustainability and biodiversity conservation. At the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, governments adopted a plan to significantly reduce the loss of biodiversity by 2010. At the 2004 meeting of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in Kuala Lumpur, governments agreed to set national and regional targets for creating networks of protected areas, including new parks, which will help safeguard biodiversity. Furthermore, all 191 Member States of the United Nations have signed up to support the Millennium Development Goals, which not only address the root causes of environmental degradation such as escalating poverty but also include a specific goal on environmental sustainability. Indicators have also been developed, which will help monitor governments progress on achieving these goals by 2015. Some might argue that governments are wasting their time talking about goals and targets, and should just get on with the job. But such public commitments to address these critical issues provide a golden opportunity. For the first time, the public can hold its leaders accountable for their success or failure in meeting measurable and quantifiable objectives on these critically important issues. WWF and other non-governmental organizations will be monitoring their progress carefully and, where we can, contributing to the achievement of global goals and targets. Equally, we will not fail to point out where nations are falling short on these aims and will continue to call for muchneeded action. The Living Planet Report 2004 is the fifth in a series of Living Planet publications, which explore the impact of man on this finite planet. The analysis highlighted in this report is part of our contribution towards measuring the worlds progress on sustainable development and biodiversity conservation. It is based on two key indicators. The first, the Living Planet Index (LPI), measures overall trends in populations of wild species around the world. It examines the planets natural wealth of vertebrate species over time and, as such, provides an indicator of the state of the worlds natural environment. The second, the Ecological Footprint, is a measure of environmental sustainability, and weighs humanitys past and present demand on the Earths renewable natural resources. We believe these two indicators give us vital information about the state of the worlds ecosystems and the human pressures affecting them. Unfortunately, the news is not good. The LPI declined by about 40 per cent from 1970 to 2000, which represents a critical blow to the vitality and resilience of the worlds natural systems. During the same period, humanitys Ecological Footprint grew to exceed the Earths biological carrying capacity by 20 per cent. Although the Ecological Footprint is not one of the agreed indicators of the Millennium Development Goals, it is nonetheless a crucial yardstick, as it measures the total burden placed on the global environment by humanity. When we compare the current Ecological Footprint with the capacity of the Earths life-supporting ecosystems, we must conclude that we no longer live within the sustainable limits of the planet. Ecosystems are suffering, the global climate is changing, and the further we continue down this path of unsustainable consumption and exploitation, the more difficult it will become to protect and restore the biodiversity that remains. We support the governments of the United Nations in their bold efforts to set and measure goals and targets but, having agreed them, we must redouble our efforts to work together to attain them. The figures contained in this latest report are a startling reminder that the time to act is now. Dr Claude Martin Director General, WWF International},

abstract = {There is growing awareness that 'nature-based solutions' (NbS) can help to protect us from climate change impacts while slowing further warming, supporting biodiversity and securing ecosystem services. However, the potential of NbS to provide the intended benefits has not been rigorously assessed. There are concerns over their reliability and cost-effectiveness compared to engineered alternatives, and their resilience to climate change. Trade-offs can arise if climate mitigation policy encourages NbS with low biodiversity value, such as afforestation with non-native monocultures. This can result in maladaptation, especially in a rapidly changing world where biodiversity-based resilience and multi-functional landscapes are key. Here, we highlight the rise of NbS in climate policy-focusing on their potential for climate change adaptation as well as mitigation-and discuss barriers to their evidence-based implementation. We outline the major financial and governance challenges to implementing NbS at scale, highlighting avenues for further research. As climate policy turns increasingly towards greenhouse gas removal approaches such as afforestation, we stress the urgent need for natural and social scientists to engage with policy makers. They must ensure that NbS can achieve their potential to tackle both the climate and biodiversity crisis while also contributing to sustainable development. This will require systemic change in the way we conduct research and run our institutions.},

abstract = {Better stewardship of land is needed to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement goal of holding warming to below 2 °C; however, confusion persists about the specific set of land stewardship options available and their mitigation potential. To address this, we identify and quantify “natural climate solutions” (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find that the maximum potential of NCS—when constrained by food security, fiber security, and biodiversity conservation—is 23.8 petagrams of CO2 equivalent (PgCO2e) y−1 (95{\%} CI 20.3–37.4). This is ≥30{\%} higher than prior estimates, which did not include the full range of options and safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3 PgCO2e y−1) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assuming the social cost of CO2 pollution is ≥100 USD MgCO2e−1 by 2030. Natural climate solutions can provide 37{\%} of cost-effective CO2 mitigation needed through 2030 for a {\textgreater}66{\%} chance of holding warming to below 2 °C. One-third of this cost-effective NCS mitigation can be delivered at or below 10 USD MgCO2−1. Most NCS actions—if effectively implemented—also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience. Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of NCS mitigation estimates. Nevertheless, existing knowledge reported here provides a robust basis for immediate global action to improve ecosystem stewardship as a major solution to climate change.},

Although for the most part these investments are motivated by the desire to increase economic productivity and employment, we find that infrastructure either directly or indirectly influences the attainment of all of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including 72{\%} of the targets.

abstract = {Under climate change, many species are increasingly exposed to heatwaves, including marine species. Although marine species are expected to succumb to heatwaves, there is increasing interest in understanding why some can persist. As heatwaves can greatly elevate intertidal seawater temperature, we explore reasons for variation in biological performance to acute thermal stress among three species of intertidal gastropods. When thermal refuges were unavailable for adaptive behavior, we show that their biological performance (feeding rate) was either maintained (resistant), recovered from a decline (resilient), or collapsed (sensitive), depending on the strength of molecular defense (where resistant species {\textgreater} resilient species {\textgreater} sensitive species). The integration of molecular, physiological, and behavioral responses within a species illustrates the kind of adaptive capacity that allows organisms to survive heatwaves and maintain their ecological functions. In this era of unprecedented environmental change, understanding how organisms persist seems as important as understanding how organisms perish.},

abstract = {There is growing awareness that 'nature-based solutions' (NbS) can help to protect us from climate change impacts while slowing further warming, supporting biodiversity and securing ecosystem services. However, the potential of NbS to provide the intended benefits has not been rigorously assessed. There are concerns over their reliability and cost-effectiveness compared to engineered alternatives, and their resilience to climate change. Trade-offs can arise if climate mitigation policy encourages NbS with low biodiversity value, such as afforestation with non-native monocultures. This can result in maladaptation, especially in a rapidly changing world where biodiversity-based resilience and multi-functional landscapes are key. Here, we highlight the rise of NbS in climate policy-focusing on their potential for climate change adaptation as well as mitigation-and discuss barriers to their evidence-based implementation. We outline the major financial and governance challenges to implementing NbS at scale, highlighting avenues for further research. As climate policy turns increasingly towards greenhouse gas removal approaches such as afforestation, we stress the urgent need for natural and social scientists to engage with policy makers. They must ensure that NbS can achieve their potential to tackle both the climate and biodiversity crisis while also contributing to sustainable development. This will require systemic change in the way we conduct research and run our institutions.},

abstract = {A system-of-systems approach: In Part I of this volume, we make the case for taking a systems approach for planning national infrastructure. Analysis of infrastructure systems has conventionally dealt with each infrastructure sector – energy, transport, water, waste, digital communications and others – in isolation. Each of these sectors has their own planning approaches and specific ways of making the business case for investment. The development of investment plans has been based on assumptions that have been developed for each sector: of demand from households and industries, and of the hazards to which the systems may be exposed. Even when cross-sectoral interdependencies are significant, for example, in thermoelectric energy generators' demand for cooling water, these have been dealt with via assumptions based on past experience. These approaches have enabled the development of the elaborate systems that we now witness, which sustain modern societies and economies. The analysis described in this book is motivated by a hypothesis that the current approaches to planning, design and management of infrastructure systems that have served modern societies well in the past are not fit for purpose as we move into the future. We are already observing increasing convergence of infrastructure services, enabled by technology – information and communications technologies (ICT) in particular. Though it may be convenient to assume so, the demands for infrastructure services are not independent for each infrastructure sector. Ultimately they derive from people and businesses who are demanding multiple infrastructure services in ways that are correlated in space and time and across sectors. By considering infrastructure services in combination rather than in isolation, there are opportunities both to access synergies and to manage the risks of interdependence. In Part II of this volume, we have considered each infrastructure sector separately, recognising their distinctive characteristics. Energy, transport, water, waste and digital communications are distinctly different systems, making use of specialised technologies that need to be understood if they are to be managed effectively in the future. These chapters have provided an overview of how these systems function and have each used new national infrastructure system models to analyse the prospects for the future under changing patterns of demand. We have explored the range of technological options that might be adopted in the foreseeable future and analysed contrasting strategies for infrastructure provision in these systems.},

abstract = {It is always necessary to make decisions in the absence of perfect information. In the past, uncertainty has been implicitly accounted for in flood risk management decisions through safety factors and allowances rather than via explicit analysis. Recognising uncertainty does not, however, prevent decisions being made. In fact, recognising uncertainty is a key requirement for appropriately designing adaptive capacity and resilience into flood risk management choices. Only by quantifying and acknowledging uncertainty are we better placed to decide how best to manage it. Perhaps the largest of these uncertainties is associated with future conditions. Climate and demographic change can have a profound influence on flood risk management and the management choices made. Infrastructure choices made today will persist for several decades if not centuries, so taking a longer term, strategic view when planning infrastructure investment is critical to making the right choice. This chapter explores various methods and approaches that have been applied in practice, as well as those emerging from research, to support good decision making under uncertainty, including scenario development, robust decision-making and adaptive management (based on multi-stage interventions), and in particular how adaptive capacity can be appropriately embedded within infrastructure design and management using real option approaches.},

@book{Cohen-Shacham2016,
abstract = {Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are defined by IUCN as actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges (e.g. climate change, food and water security or natural disasters) effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. The NbS concept, as used in environmental sciences and nature conservation contexts, has emerged within the last decade or so, as international organisations search for ways to work with ecosystems – rather than relying on conventional engineering solutions (such as seawalls) – to adapt to and mitigate climate change effects, while improving sustainable livelihoods and protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity. NbS is a relatively ‘young' concept, still in the process of being framed. There is a need now to deepen our understanding of NbS and confirm the principles upon which NbS is based, in order to move towards an operational framework that can guide applications of the NbS concept. The following set of NbS principles are proposed. Nature-based Solutions: 1. embrace nature conservation norms (and principles); 2. can be implemented alone or in an integrated manner with other solutions to societal challenges (e.g. technological and engineering solutions); 3. are determined by site-specific natural and cultural contexts that include traditional, local and scientific knowledge; 4. produce societal benefits in a fair and equitable way, in a manner that promotes transparency and broad participation; 5. maintain biological and cultural diversity and the ability of ecosystems to evolve over time; 6. are applied at the scale at a landscape; 7. recognise and address the trade-offs between the production of a few immediate economic benefits for development, and future options for the production of the full range of ecosystems services; 8. are an integral part of the overall design of policies, and measures or actions, to address a specific challenge. NbS is best considered an umbrella concept that covers a range of different approaches. These approaches have emerged from a variety of spheres (some from the scientific research domain, others from practice or policy contexts) but share a common focus on ecosystem services and aim to address societal challenges. These NbS approaches can be classified into: (i) ecosystem restoration approaches (e.g. ecological restoration, ecological engineering and forest landscape restoration); (ii) issuespecific ecosystem-related approaches (e.g. ecosystem-based adaptation, ecosystem-based mitigation, and ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction); (iii) infrastructure-related approaches (e.g. natural infrastructure and green infrastructure approaches); (iv) ecosystembased management approaches (e.g. integrated coastal zone management and integrated water resources management); and (v) ecosystem protection approaches (e.g. area-based conservation approaches including protected area management). A lack of operational clarity presents a major obstacle to the credibility and applicability of new concepts in the fields of conservation and development. Several parallel exercises are currently underway to develop operational parameters for specific NbS approaches (such as Ecosystem-based Adaptation and REDD+), each proposing its own set of criteria. Many of these criteria could be relevant for other approaches within the NbS ‘family' and there is likely an overarching set of parameters, or ‘standards', that can guide implementation of all types of NbS interventions. To help in this endeavour, five preliminary parameters are proposed: ecological complexity, long-term stability, scale of ecological organisation, direct societal benefits and adaptive governance. By unifying NbS approaches under a single operational framework, it becomes possible to scale up their implementation and strengthen their impact in mitigating the world's most pressing challenges.},

abstract = {Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8°C to 1.2°C. Global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. (high confidence) Warming from anthropogenic emissions from the pre-industrial period to the present will persist for centuries to millennia and will continue to cause further long-term changes in the climate system, such as sea level rise, with associated impacts (high confidence), but these emissions alone are unlikely to cause global warming of 1.5°C (medium confidence). Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5°C than at present, but lower than at 2°C (high confidence). These risks depend on the magnitude and rate of warming, geographic location, levels of development and vulnerability, and on the choices and implementation of adaptation and mitigation options (high confidence). Projected Climate Change, Potential Impacts and Associated Risks Climate models project robust differences in regional climate characteristics between present-day and global warming of 1.5°C, and between 1.5°C and 2°C. These differences include increases in: mean temperature in most land and ocean regions (high confidence), hot extremes in most inhabited regions (high confidence), heavy precipitation in several regions (medium confidence), and the probability of drought and precipitation deficits in some regions (medium confidence). By 2100, global mean sea level rise is projected to be around 0.1 metre lower with global warming of 1.5°C compared to 2°C (medium confidence). Sea level will continue to rise well beyond 2100 (high confidence), and the magnitude and rate of this rise depend on future emission pathways. A slower rate of sea level rise enables greater opportunities for adaptation in the human and ecological systems of small islands, low-lying coastal areas and deltas (medium confidence). On land, impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, including species loss and extinction, are projected to be lower at 1.5°C of global warming compared to 2°C. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C is projected to lower the impacts on terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems and to retain more of their services to humans (high confidence). Limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C is projected to reduce increases in ocean temperature as well as associated increases in ocean acidity and decreases in ocean oxygen levels (high confidence). Consequently, limiting global warming to 1.5°C is projected to reduce risks to marine biodiversity, fisheries, and ecosystems, and their functions and services to humans, as illustrated by recent changes to Arctic sea ice and warm-water coral reef ecosystems (high confidence). Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C and increase further with 2°C. Most adaptation needs will be lower for global warming of 1.5°C compared to 2°C (high confidence). There are a wide range of adaptation options that can reduce the risks of climate change (high confidence). There are limits to adaptation and adaptive capacity for some human and natural systems at global warming of 1.5°C, with associated losses (medium confidence). The number and availability of adaptation options vary by sector (medium confidence). * Headline statements are the overarching conclusions of the approved Summary for Policymakers which, taken together, provide a concise narrative.},

abstract = {Globally, the need for infrastructure investment, is forecast to reach {\$}94 trillion by 2040, and a further {\$}3.5 trillion will be required to meet the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals for electricity and water. Outlook reveals where investment is most likely to fall short, and therefore where the needs are greatest, across 50 countries and seven sectors. It considers what investment is needed and what is likely to occur based on a range of factors, such as a country's historic infrastructure spending levels and how its population and economy is changing, hence identifying investment gaps. The findings are compelling. For instance, Asia has the largest overall need, requiring just over 50{\%} of global investment in infrastructure, however the region is forecast to have a relatively small investment gap. The picture is very different in other regions where investment gaps are more prominent. The Americas and Africa, by contrast, are forecast to have proportionally much larger infrastructure investment gaps. In these regions investment gap is 32{\%} and 28{\%} respectively of investment need. Africa's investment gap is forecast to widen further to 43{\%}, if investment need includes SDGs. Quantifying country-level needs is a powerful and positive step. These insights will help governments identify and respond to infrastructure needs, and guide opportunities for private sector investors. Many countries are increasingly focussed on the role of infrastructure to improve economic growth and community wellbeing. With the right information, policy leadership and supportive financing environments the investment gaps highlighted in this report can be successfully addressed. Outlook provides that information to help in identifying and funding the effective infrastructure plans to support stronger economic growth and more prosperous and liveable communities},

It opens the decision space and helps to overcome policy paralysis due to deep uncertainty. There are different routes that can achieve the objectives under changing conditions (like ‘different roads leading to Rome'). Policy actions have an uncertain design life and might fail sooner or later to continue achieving objectives as the operating conditions change (i.e. they reach an adaptation tipping point (ATP)). Similarly, opportunity tipping points may occur. Multiple pathways are typically visualized in a metro map or decision tree, with time or changing conditions on one of the axes. DAPP supports the design of a dynamic adaptive strategy that includes initial actions, long-term options, and adaptation signals to identify when to implement the long-term options or revisit decisions.},

It focuses on papers that provide examples of how biodiversity components (that is, ecosystems, species and genes) directly deliver benefits that may contribute to the achievement of individual SDGs.
