# Introduction to the need for cooling

Cities around the world are increasingly threatened by rising
temperatures. In Europe, over 140,000 deaths have been associated with
83 heatwaves since the beginning of the century [@UNEP2020]. By 2050
it is expected that around 1,000 cities will experience summertime
temperature highs of 25°C, implying an increase of 800% of urban
populations exposed to such temperatures [@Kapos2019]. Such increases
in heat will have adverse impacts on human health, well-being, urban
infrastructure and services, particularly for cities in the most
vulnerable and disadvantaged areas [@Kapos2019].

These increasing temperatures will change the demand for energy. The
International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that cooling degree days
will increase by an average of approximately 25% by 2050 at the global
level. This would result in a threefold increase in energy demand for
cooling during that time period, from 2,020TWh to 6,200TWh in 2050, all
in the form of electricity [@Hall2019]. High temperatures could
therefore incur an economic cost of USD2 trillion globally by 2030
[@Kapos2019]. Moreover, the generation of the electricity required to
operate air conditioners will itself produces additional emissions,
leading towards a vicious cycle of warming and cooling [@UNEP2020].

The health impacts of heat waves are exacerbated in cities due to the
high density of buildings, high concentration of air pollutants and the
fragmentation of green areas [@Depietri2013]. The more the planet
warms, the more cities require new ways of keeping temperatures down
[@UNEP2020]. Nature-based solutions, or "urban greening" can lower
local temperatures through canopy cover, shading and evaporative cooling
[@Kapos2019], mitigating the human health consequences from increased
temperatures [@Bowler2010].

# The urban heat island (UHI) effect 

Atmospheric temperature within forested or natural areas have been shown
to be lower than that in non-green urban sites [@Bowler2010]. This is
due to a phenomenon called the urban heat island (UHI) effect. City
landscapes are dominated by grey infrastructure, which consists of hard,
impervious surfaces such as buildings and roads, which trap and radiate
heat, keeping the city warm long after the sun has gone down (see Figure
16.4.2) [@UNEP2020; @Makido2019; @Wong2021]. The low albedo, low
green cover and low moisture availability within cities exacerbate this
effect [@Depietri2013]. Moreover, waste heat from engines and other
energy-consuming equipment in industry, air-conditioning and
transportation further add heat (and air pollution) to the city air
circulation system [@UNEP2020; @Depietri2013].

**Figure 16.4.2:** Conceptualisation of the urban heat island effect
[@Wong2021]

The UHI effect, combined with globally warming temperatures, will likely
cause an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events
in cities [@Makido2019]. Often, as poorer neighbourhoods have less
accessibility to air conditioners and breezy green spaces, vulnerable
people in these neighbourhoods are at greater risk of health
complications related to heat [@UNEP2020].

It is therefore essential to tackle urban heat. Large-scale air
conditioning requires significant investment and is very
energy-intensive. Nature-based solutions in the form of blue and/or
green infrastructure can offer cost-effective cooling via shade and
evapotranspiration [@Makido2019].

# Nature-based solutions for UHI mitigation 

The air temperature difference between natural areas and urban areas
with less vegetation can be as much as 4°C [@Kapos2019;
@Bowler2010]. Nature-based solutions are therefore gaining traction
for mitigating the UHI effect, with some studies showing that trees
within cities can cut 10% of the costs required for air conditioning
[@Kapos2019]. Increasing the number of water bodies in cities can
also reduce urban temperatures by up to 0.9°C [@Kapos2019].

Nature-based solutions for mitigating the UHI effect include increasing
canopy cover, increasing the number and size of green spaces, restoring
forests and wetlands, and constructing green roofs and agroforestry
systems that include trees in cultivated and settled areas
[@Kapos2019; @Wong2021]. These measures can be complemented with
other solutions, such as using light colours for roofs, walls and
pavements to reflect more sunlight [@Kapos2019]. These natural
processes increase shading and provide evaporative cooling
[@Kapos2019; @Bowler2010; @Gill2007]. Evapotranspiration consumes
energy from solar radiation and translates this into latent heat rather
than sensible heat, cooling the leaf and the surrounding air, whereas
urban surfaces absorb and retain heat when exposed to solar radiation
[@Bowler2010; @Wong2021].

**Figure 16.4.3:** (a) Proposed framework for implementing nature-based
solutions in urban environments at different scales; and (b) a summary
of cooling benefits from nature-based solutions [@Wong2021]

These nature-based solutions also provide co-benefits, such as carbon
sequestration and storage, improved soil fertility, pollution control,
biodiversity conservation, tourism opportunities, and improved physical
and mental health in urban populations [@Kapos2019].

# Nature-based solutions for cooling at the building scale

In many urban environments, the built form is already established,
leaving little room for creating large new greenspaces. Green and blue
infrastructure will thus have to be added to cities creatively, through
the opportunities of greening buildings [@Gill2007]. Similar to
greenery on the ground, greenery on buildings cools the building
(through enhanced thermal insulation) and surrounding air by modifying
evapotranspiration, providing shade and raising the albedo
[@Wong2021]. Figure 16.4.4 below illustrates the different
opportunities for heat mitigation using nature-based solutions at the
building scale.

**Figure 16.4.4:** Nature-based solutions for heat mitigation at the
building scale [@Wong2021]

There are a few considerations associated with the implementation of
green walls and green roofs. For instance, the effectiveness of green
walls and green roofs is influenced by their placement, specifically
through self-shading or overshadowing from surrounding buildings
[@Wong2021]. In addition, the cooling effect of vertical and rooftop
greenery is more effective in the summer, when there is higher
evapotranspiration and foliage density.

These nature-based solutions for regulating external air temperatures
can also be applied indoors. Figure 16.4.5 illustrates a photograph of
the David Attenborough Building in Cambridge, UK. Here, a four-storey
tall living green wall naturally cools the building, filters the air,
and stimulates health and well-being in the working environment.

# Case study of urban greening: Singapore

Singapore is a city state with one of the highest population densities
in the world. It is almost 100% urbanised, with a population of over 5.6
million (growing at 1.2% annually), living in an area just larger than
720km^2^ [@Vahanvati2020]. The city suffers from the UHI effect, with
summer temperatures being up to 7°C higher in the central business
district than in surrounding areas [@Vahanvati2020]. With the
population of Singapore growing, and global temperatures rising, the UHI
effect is certain to challenge the well-being of local inhabitants.

The government-funded "Cooling Singapore" project has joined government
agencies with local and international researchers to develop strategies
to reduce the UHI effect and improve outdoor thermal comfort
[@Vahanvati2020]. The collaboration extends to local councils, which
will see the implementation of nature-based solutions in buildings,
landscapes, parklands and waterways, and in transport and energy
infrastructure [@Vahanvati2020]. Currently, parks, nature reserves
and reservoirs occupy 13% of land use (Figure 16.4.6). In order to
increase the amount of green and blue infrastructure on the small
island, it is now obligatory to include greenery on roofs and on upper
levels of buildings or walls [@Vahanvati2020]. Green roofs and walls
are attractive nature-based solutions for Singapore because
[@Ruefenacht2017]:

1.  The elevated position of the sun throughout the year produces
    intense vertical radiation over planar surfaces such as roofs

2.  The high humidity of this tropical city increases the performance
    and growth of vegetation, and minimises the water required for
    maintenance of vegetation.

Overall, studies have shown that temperatures within the large green
areas of the city have reduced by 4.0°C compared to the other areas of
the urban centre [@Wong2005]. These urban parks have also been
implemented in an unrivalled aesthetical way, illustrating the
creativity and innovation behind the urban landscape design of the city.
