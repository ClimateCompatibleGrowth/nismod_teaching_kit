abstract = {Despite climate change mitigation and sustainability agendas, road transport systems in Germany and the resulting environmental burden are growing. Road transport is a significant source of emissions in urban areas and the infrastructure has a significant impact on the urban form. Nevertheless, mobility is a fundamental requirement for the satisfaction of the human desire to socially and economically engage in society. Considering these realities and the desire for sustainable development in a growing city (Potsdam, Germany), an integrated assessment methodology was co-developed among scientists and practitioners to prioritize a suite of transport-related measures. The methodology reflects the city's qualitative and quantitative goals to improve public transport and promote sustainability, capturing synergies in categories that include environmental considerations as well as road safety, eco-mobility, and quality of life. This approach applies a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) to derive a practically relevant solution for the local traffic and mobility problems that fosters ownership and accountability of all involved. This paper reflects on the process of developing the MCA, and the different aspects that were found important and required consideration during the process. Recommendations on specific traffic-related measures and the assessment of their effectiveness are not given. The aim is that such process information could foster greater collaboration within city departments and similar transdisciplinary efforts.},

abstract = {In recent years, integrated networks of green spaces at city scale, or "green infrastructure" (GI), are seen increasingly as fundamental to the delivery of ecosystem services for human and environmental health. A range of models that assess the performance of specific aspects and elements related to GI have been developed in response. However, there is no model that is comprehensive and integrative across all types of GI and ecosystem services. This paper aims to suggest a set of potential indicators that facilitate the development of an inclusive model for the sustainability assessment of GI performance. This research is based on the findings from a previous study conducted by the authors that identified definitions, types and conceptual framework of GI as well as thirty performance indicators through reviewing literature and incorporating results from semi-structured interviews involving twenty-one selected Australian representative experts. This analysis was combined with input from 373 national and international stakeholders through an online questionnaire to establish an integrated framework by weighting, screening and aggregating selected indicators. This framework comprises a reduced set of sixteen potential indicators based on experts' perspectives which represent the key interactions between human health, ecosystem services and ecosystem health across four dimensions (ecological, economic, socio-cultural and health). Future research will involve testing this proposed framework and providing a platform for decision-makers to test various scenarios based on the base case and existing conditions to provide an early warning of changes in the sustainability levels in the urban environment.},

abstract = {Renewable generating technologies offer an effective means for climate change mitigation. Policy makers, however, are wary because of the widespread perception that these technologies cost more than conventional alternatives so that increasing their deployment will raise overall electricity generating costs. Energy planning represents an investment-decision problem. Investors commonly evaluate such problems using portfolio theory to manage risk and maximize portfolio performance under a variety of unpredictable economic outcomes. Energy planners need to similarly abandon their reliance on traditional, "least-cost" stand-alone kWh generating cost measures and instead evaluate conventional and renewable energy sources on the basis of their portfolio cost - their cost contribution relative to their risk contribution to a mix of generating assets. Energy security generally focuses on the threat of abrupt supply disruptions. This paper suggests a more profound aspect: mitigating fossil price volatility. An extensive body of research indicates that fossil volatility significantly disrupts the economies of consuming nations, potentially exacting hundreds of billions of dollars from the US and EU economies alone. Energy security is reduced when countries hold inefficient portfolios that are needlessly exposed to fossil price risks. This paper describes essential portfolio-theory ideas and uses three case studies to illustrate how electricity-generating mixes can benefit from additional shares of wind, geothermal and other renewables. Compared to existing, fossil-dominated mixes, efficient portfolios reduce generating cost while including greater renewables shares in the mix thereby enhancing energy security. Though counter-intuitive, the idea that adding more costly renewables can actually reduce portfolio-generating cost is consistent with basic finance theory. An important implication is that in dynamic and uncertain environments, the relative value of generating technologies must be determined not by evaluating alternative resources, but by evaluating alternative resource portfolios. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach for practically tackling uncertainty in preference elicitation and predictive modeling to support complex multi-criteria decisions based onmulti-attribute utility theory (MAUT). A simplified two-step elicitation procedure consisting of an online survey and face-to-face interviews is followed by an extensive uncertainty analysis. This covers uncertainty of the preference components (marginal value and utility functions, hierarchical aggregation functions, aggregation parameters) and the attribute predictions. Context uncertainties about future socio-economic developments are captured by combining MAUT with scenario planning. We perform a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to assess the contribution of single uncertain preference parameters to the uncertainty of the ranking of alternatives. This is exemplified for sustainable water infrastructure planning in a case study in Switzerland. We compare 11 water supply alternatives ranging from conventional water supply systems to novel technologies and management schemes regarding 44 objectives. Their performance is assessed for four future scenarios and 10 stakeholders from different backgrounds and decision-making levels. Despite uncertainty in the ranking of alternatives, potential best and worst solutions could be identified. We demonstrate that a priori assumptions such as linear value functions or additive aggregation can result in misleading recommendations, unless thoroughly checked during preference elicitation and modeling. We suggest GSA to focus elicitation on most sensitive preference parameters. Our GSA results indicate that output uncertainty can be considerably reduced by additional elicitation of few parameters, e.g. the overall risk attitude and aggregation functions at higher-level nodes. Here, rough value function elicitation was sufficient, thereby substantially reducing elicitation time.},

Infrastructure projects will continue to be developed in the coming years, particularly in developing countries such as China and India; therefore, it is important to find methods and solutions for improving the sustainability of them. Although existing studies have suggested various methods for practicing sustainable development principles in the process of implementing infrastructure projects, effective assessment indicators are unavailable, which presents a barrier to the effective assessment of infrastructure project sustainability. This study introduces key assessment indicators (KAIs) for assessing the sustainability performance of an infrastructure project. The research data used for analysis were collected from a questionnaire survey given to three groups of experts, including government officials, professionals, and clients in the Chinese construction industry. The fuzzy set theory was used to establish KAIs. A procedure for using the KAIs is demonstrated by a case study.

abstract = {While the definition of a sustainable transportation system is varied, there is emerging consensus that transportation system sustainability should capture attributes of system effectiveness and system impacts on economic development, environmental integrity, and social quality of life. Sustainability assessment can be incorporated at the planning level in order to influence decision making, and support policies that affect regional sustainability. This paper reviews methodologies that can be applied in sustainability assessment in transportation planning in order to shed light on the procedures being used to incorporate sustainability more effectively in the planning process. Using data from the Atlanta Metropolitan Region, the study identifies performance measures based on sustainability issues and regional goals and evaluates proposed transportation and land use alternatives. The study evaluates and discusses several performance measures and aggregates them into indexes representing four parameters of sustainability: system effectiveness, environmental, economic, and social impacts, to enable visualization and assessment of tradeoffs and dominance for the competing alternatives. This study is potentially useful to agencies interested in understanding the range of tools being used for sustainability assessment, expanding or refining their performance measures to capture sustainability in transportation planning, and using them in evaluating tradeoffs among competing alternatives as well as in identifying dominant alternatives. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Human activities such as urban densification, soil sealing and the spread of service infrastructure are altering the quality and quantity of ecosystems. They are depleting natural capital, like water supply and air quality, on which society depends. To preserve natural capital, the European Commission is promoting new land-use policies, one of which is Green Infrastructure (GI). It has been postulated that GI planning can promote sustainable land-use by supporting a wide range of ecosystem services. Research conducted in the GREEN SURGE project (FP7-ENV.2013.6.2-5-603567) has suggested that a number of tangible benefits accrue when GI planning is implemented at different spatial scales. In support of this, GI has been conceptualized in a case study in Southern Italy using the Driving force–Pressure–State–Impact–Response (DPSIR) framework. This framework was employed to promote the GI approach with the aim of ensuring sustainable land development without compromising natural capital. In fact, the DPSIR framework used in the case study shows how GI, through the provision of ecosystem services, is a response to various critical environmental issues. Despite known limitations as reported in the literature, the DPSIR framework was selected for its simplicity in representing and reporting the interactions between the environment and society. Given the complexity of environmental issues and the presence of various stakeholders involved in decision-making processes, DPSIR provides planning professionals with a streamlined tool to develop strategic solutions for sustainable land-use and for promoting societal wellbeing.},

Few studies have applied quantitative methods, and there has not been a systematic review of energy sustainability. To fill this gap, this study first developed a sustainable energy evaluation index system consisting of 20 indicators across the three dimensions of economy, energy, and environment based on the pressure-state-response (PSR) model. The weights of these indicators were then determined in conjunction with the weighting method. Finally, the matter-element extension method was improved to quantify energy sustainability. The proposed method was applied to evaluate China's energy sustainability status from 2000 to 2015. The results show that China's status continued to improve; however, it remained at a low level. To improve China's energy sustainability, more efforts are needed in the economic, energy, and environmental dimensions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Urban densification is seen as a possible solution in response to the intense urbanization and sustainable development. Urban densification counteracts the negative effects of urban sprawl, which include increased mobility challenges, demand of natural resources, greenhouse gas emissions, and encroachment on green spaces. In spite of its benefits, urban densification creates pressure on the existing buried water infrastructure (BWI) (i.e., drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater) and the environment. The impacts of urban densification on the level of service of BWI are overlooked in the published literature. This study aims to identify and discuss the key drivers, induced pressures, their effects on the level of service, corresponding impacts, and finally the possible responses using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) linkage-based sustainability assessment framework. The DPSIR framework was selected due to its simplicity and most powerful communication tool between environment and society. The outcome of this study provide a conceptual model, which interlinks the steps (i) identification of system indicators, (ii) data processing, (iii) decision making, and (iv) impact analysis with factors influencing the integrated level of service of BWI at three different levels. Together these steps create a basis for evaluating the level of service of multifaceted BWI. The uncertainties associated with scenarios, datasets, and model development could be a challenge during the application of proposed conceptual framework. The proposed conceptual model may serve as reference for multi-stakeholders in understanding the dynamic balance between urban densification, BWI, and sustainable use of water services.},

These include air and water pollution, waste management, and the protection of biodiversity and other natural assets. The indicators in this report are those that are regularly used in the OECD's work and for which data are available for a majority of OECD countries. For more than 30 years, the OECD has prepared harmonised international data and sets of indicators on the environment, assisted countries to improve their environmental information systems. The main aims of this work have been to: • Measure environmental progress and performance. • Monitor and promote policy integration, in particular, the integration of environmental considerations into policy sectors, such as transport, energy and agriculture, and into economic policies more broadly. • Help monitor progress towards sustainable development and green growth by measuring the extent of decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth. The OECD approach to indicators is based on the view that: • There is no unique set of indicators; whether a given set of indicators is appropriate depends on its use. • Indicators are only one tool among others and generally should be used with other information in order to draw robust conclusions. • OECD environmental indicators are relatively small sets of indicators that have been identified for use at the international level, and should be complemented by national indicators when examining issues at national level. The programme builds on agreement by OECD member countries to: • Use the pressure-state-response (PSR) model as a common reference framework. • Identify indicators on the basis of their policy relevance, analytical soundness and measurability. • Use the OECD approach and adapt it to their national circumstances.},

Reaching these goals will require deep transformations in every country, as well as major efforts in monitoring and measuring progress. Here we introduce the SDG Index and Dashboards as analytical tools for assessing countries' baselines for the SDGs that can be applied by researchers in the cross-disciplinary analyses required for implementation. The Index and Dashboards synthesize available country-level data for all 17 goals, and for each country estimate the size of the gap towards achieving the SDGs. They will be updated annually. All 149 countries for which sufficient data is available face significant challenges in achieving the goals, and many countries' development strategies are imbalanced across the economic, social and environmental priorities. We illustrate the analytical value of the index by examining its relationship with other widely used development indices and by showing how it accounts for cross-national differences in subjective well-being. Given significant data gaps, scope and coverage of the Index and Dashboards are limited, but we suggest that these analyses represent a starting point for a comprehensive assessment of national SDG baselines and can help policymakers determine priorities for early action and monitor progress. The tools also identify data gaps that must be closed for SDG monitoring.},

Along with the need for secure water supplies, we must ensure that the supply is affordable and that sufficient water is available to safeguard the natural environment. Meeting these three separate goals of security, affordability and sustainability, with their inevitable trade-offs, can be termed the ‘water trilemma'. In this novel approach we simulate projections of river flows under population and climate change by using an aggregated national water resource model to test potential policies to manage demand and investments in water supply infrastructure in order to assess Britain's ability to meet its needs into the future. The results indicate that a balanced approach which allows for some inter-basin water transfers while also engaging local solutions, including water re-use, combined with scalable actions for demand management and leakage reduction, will best enable Britain to navigate this water trilemma.},

abstract = {In the lead-up to the 2015 Conference of Parties meeting in Paris, 186 countries, representing over 95{\%} of global emissions, submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The NDCs outline national goals for greenhouse gas emission reductions and identify financial needs for unfolding mitigation and adaptation efforts. In this study, we review various analyses of the NDCs that cover the aggregate impact and strength of emissions reduction commitments and discuss recent literature on the adequacy and sectoral focus of the NDCs. We then argue that the NDCs are more than just goal setting reports; they are important discursive documents that are contested, negotiated, and ongoing. To supplement the existing literature, we examine the discursive narratives embedded in the NDCs from the 19 founding nations of the Climate Vulnerable Forum and the top 10 greenhouse gas emitters. Our literature review of quantitative and sectoral aspects of the NDCs highlights the inadequacy of the NDC commitments in the context of limiting warming to 2°C, discusses the uncertainties in the promised mitigation strategies, and identifies the reliance of many countries on policies such as those on forests or renewable energy. Our own analysis of the discourses in the NDCs adds critical depth by highlighting the stark contrasts in NDC discourses between North and South, as well as between historical emitters and emerging economies. These contrasts reflect deeper debates regarding justice and equity between nations within the UNFCCC negotiations.

abstract = {In 2015, the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development were adopted, bringing about a shift from legally binding emission mitigation targets based on common metrics for developed countries only, towards voluntary commitments for all. Our content analysis of countries' climate activities in 164 nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement reveals that these are closely connected to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda). This article explores the connections between the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda at a global level, across all NDCs, and also analyses detailed connections at SDG target level for a subset of six developing countries. At the national level, focusing on developing countries that have not yet drafted a National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) and taking account of both overlaps and gaps, the article suggests ways to promote thematic coherence between both agendas and make use of this unique window of opportunity to draft NSDSs and update NDCs, making them more ambitious. Key policy insights NDCs propose many activities that also contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Underlining the connection between NDCs and SDGs can strengthen buy-in among various stakeholder groups in society for more ambitious NDCs. At the target level, energy efficiency (SDG 7), sustainable forest management (SDG 15), sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), sustainable transport systems (SDG 11) and water-use efficiency (SDG 6) are priority areas for thematic coherence between the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. An assessment of thematic policy coherence between the voluntary domestic contributions regarding the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda should be integrated in national policy cycles for sustainable and climate policy-making to identify overlaps, gaps, mutual benefits and trade-offs in national policies. The periodic updates of NDCs and the drafting of National Sustainable Development Strategies (NSDSs) should be used by countries to align their domestic contributions in order to implement the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda coherently. Our ‘three-step linkage framework' offers a method for this.},

abstract = {Although links exist between development targets, such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and climate change goals of adaptation and mitigation, the nature and extent of those links have only been loosely explored in the literature. While efforts to integrate climate change adaptation into development are increasingly prevalent, gaps remain in understanding the specific relationships, potential synergies, and trade-offs in the integration process. This article reviews the links and identifies and analyses three main themes. First, the review suggests that tools are needed to more effectively capture interactions within decision-making processes, and proposes a framework for more focused analyses of these relationships. Second, the framework supports examination of the two sets of goals - development and climate - together, evaluating alternative policies and programmes for their outcomes and identifying key relationships between development, poverty alleviation, and climate goals in both present and future planning processes (such as the MDGs beyond 2015). Finally, by using analytical visualizations, policy and decision makers assisted by relevant stakeholders could identify potential synergies and trade-offs, propose adaptation and mitigation actions, and design appropriate measurements and evaluations. The framework is designed to help direct efforts toward policy and programme outcomes that can best support development and mitigation and adaptation to climate change goals. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Promoting inclusive and sustainable economic and social development whilst simultaneously adapting to climate change impacts and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions – Climate Compatible Development (CCD) – requires coherent policy approaches that span multiple sectors. This paper develops and applies a qualitative content analysis to assess national sector policies of ten southern African countries to determine their approaches for water, agriculture, forestry and energy and their compatibility with the aims of the three dimensions of CCD (development, climate adaptation and climate mitigation). Results indicate that sector policies currently only partially support shifts towards CCD, with approaches that both complement and detract from CCD being prioritized by national governments. Agriculture offers the greatest number of potentially viable approaches capable of achieving the development, adaptation and mitigation aims inherent in CCD, while energy the least. National governments should focus on developing coherent, cross-sector approaches that deliver such potential triple wins in order to promote new forms of inclusive and sustainable economic and social development, whilst facilitating adaptation to climate change impacts and supporting mitigation activities. Doing so will also go a long way towards ensuring the progress needed for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Climate Agreement.},

abstract = {The concept of climate compatible development (CCD) is increasingly employed by donors and policy makers seeking ‘triple-wins' for development, adaptation and mitigation. While CCD rhetoric is becoming more widespread, analyses drawing on empirical cases that present triple-wins are sorely lacking. We address this knowledge gap. Drawing on examples in rural sub-Saharan Africa, we provide the first glimpse into how projects that demonstrate triple-win potential are framed and presented within the scientific literature. We identify that development projects are still commonly evaluated in terms of adaptation or mitigation benefits. Few are framed according to their benefits across all three dimensions. Consequently, where triple-wins are occurring, they are likely to be under-reported. This has important implications, which underestimates the co-benefits that projects can deliver. A more robust academic evidence base for the delivery of triple-wins is necessary to encourage continued donor investment in activities offering the potential to deliver CCD.},

@article{Winkler2015,
abstract = {Reconsidering development by reflecting on climate change means rethinking development goals, more than pursuing climate targets. Much analysis in the development–climate literature has framed development as a co-benefit, while the objective has been climate stabilization. This misses the point that development drives emissions, not vice versa. A different approach must address low-emission technologies, but also the high-emission parts of ‘development'. Politically, climate change must be understood as a development problem. In this conception, a key task for climate policy is to explore different development paths, with the difference in emissions being a result. Development goals need to be represented as explicit objectives, both in analytical modelling and as political goals. Methods that treat climate policy as a self-control mechanism in the development system, or back-cast from development goals, need to be improved. The article further considers levers to change development paths, considering lessons on how to influence change in complex systems. The obsession of the existing economic order is with economic growth and development; what needs to be considered is the quality of development and what it means to live well. A social contract for low-carbon development requires the rich to pay for mitigation, use less, and assist the poor; lift the poor out of poverty; and change the aspirations of the middle class. Such a contract requires thinking beyond short-term political and economic time frames, with much longer-term thinking and vision.},

abstract = {Co-benefits rarely enter quantitative decision-support frameworks, often because themethodologies for their integration are lacking or not known. This review fills in this gap by providing comprehensive methodological guidance on the quantification of co-impacts and their integration into climate-related decision making based on the literature. The article first clarifies the confusion in the literature about related terms and makes a proposal for a more consistent terminological framework, then emphasizes the importance of working in a multiple-objective-multiple-impact framework. It creates a taxonomy of co-impacts and uses this to propose a methodological framework for the identification of the key co-impacts to be assessed for a given climate policy and to avoid double counting. It reviews the different methods available to quantify and monetize different co-impacts and introduces three methodological frameworks that can be used to integrate these results into decision making. On the basis of an initial assessment of selected studies, it also demonstrates that the incorporation of co-impacts can significantly change the outcome of economic assessments. Finally, the review calls for major new research and innovation toward simplified evaluation methods and streamlined tools for more widely applicable appraisals of co-impacts for decision making.},
