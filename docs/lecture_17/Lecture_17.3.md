## Integrating nature-based solutions in water transport networks

While water transport infrastructure is predominantly reliant upon grey
infrastructure, such as ports, harbours, networks of canals, etc.,
nature-based solutions (NbS) can provide multiple benefits to the sector
and beyond if implemented with consideration, at costs comparable or
lower than engineered alternatives.

**Integrating NbS in ports and harbours**

Due to their low-lying nature and proximity to the coastal zone, ports
and harbours are at risk of climate impacts including flooding and storm
surges. Ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrass, reef systems (coral and
oyster) and beaches can be leveraged through NbS in order to prevent
flooding and erosion of ports and increase their resilience to climate
change (Figure 17.3.1) [@Hijdra2021]. Furthermore, NbS can provide
additional benefits to the sector, by mitigating wakes from boats and
reducing erosion of banks, thus preventing sedimentation of shipping
channels, reducing dredging requirements and associated costs, whilst
extending the lifespan of harbour walls [@VitalPorts]. Equally, NbS
can help to maintain tranquillity of waters to support navigation. The
use of living harbour wall systems can help to extend grey
infrastructure lifespans and reduce pollution of port waters
[@Perkol-Finkel2018].

**Figure 17.3.1:** Mangroves and other coastal and marine ecosystems can
protect ports from climate impacts, support tranquillity of waters and
increase navigability of shipping channels by reducing sedimentation and
mitigating erosive forces from passing boats [@Paalvast2012].

**Integrating NbS in rivers, canals and lakes**

There are various options for integrating NbS into river, canal and lake
systems [@EU2018]. For example, riparian vegetation along water
courses can deliver services including biological and pest control. This
can improve navigability of water courses and reduce the frequency of
control procedures by preventing algal blooms which clog waterways.
Equally, creation of vegetated buffer strips can reduce sheet, bank and
stream erosion, which may result from water wakes created by boats and
cause sedimentation of channels. Wetlands and reeds can mitigate channel
flooding, filter pollutants and trap sediments, as well as dissipate
wave energy and erosive forces on riverbanks from passing boats
[@ï»¿Madramootoo&Dodds1994].

## Integrating nature-based solutions into road and rail networks

Road and rail networks have a fundamental role to play in meeting basic
service needs, through facilitating the mobility of people and goods
[@UN2016]. With huge development needs for transport infrastructure
(e.g. an estimated 25 million kilometres of roads by 2050
[@WWF&ARUP2019]) and many existing transport infrastructure networks
under increasing stress from climate impacts, there is a huge
opportunity to design and integrate combined natural-built transport
networks to support and enhance service delivery within the sector.

For example, the strategic implementation of adjacent ecological
networks or corridors can mitigate flooding, stabilise sediments in
order to reduce the impact of landslides, act as firebreaks to prevent
the spreading of fires, and shade transport networks in order to reduce
the impacts of temperature or snowfall [@Kapos2019; @Black2016]. As
such, ecological corridors in the form of verges and slopes along linear
transport networks can reduce long-term costs for maintenance and
increase the lifespan of engineered assets (Figure 17.3.2) [@EU].

**Figure 17.3.2:** NbS can protect road and rail infrastructure networks
from climate impacts*.* Photograph from @Browder2019.

![](media/image3.tiff){width="6.267361111111111in"
height="2.501388888888889in"}The implementation of specific ecological
infrastructure structures, such as overpasses or underpasses, can
further increase the resilience of the sector, by facilitating the safe
movement of wildlife and preventing wildlife-induced transport
collisions (Figure 17.3.3) [@ADB2019].

**Figure 17.3.3:** Ecological underpasses and overpasses [@ADB2019;
@EU]

Furthermore, restoration of trees along road networks can provide
additional benefits to the road sector. For example, studies report that
trees can increase the attention span of drivers, act as a buffer
between pedestrians and vehicles, and make the street feel narrower,
thus reducing the driving speed of cars [@GMCA2019].

The benefits offered by integrating NbS in the transport sector are
leading to increased uptake across Europe, including in the TRANSGREEN
project which is designing an integrated transport and ecological
network in Europe for improved safety and biodiversity benefits
[@EuropeanCommission2019; @Transgreen2017].

## Integrating nature-based solutions into airports

Opportunities to integrate NbS into built infrastructure sectors extend
to the air transport sector, where they can be leveraged for
sector-related benefits. Such benefits include reducing airport costs,
extending infrastructure lifespan and enhancing the health and wellbeing
of passengers and staff. For example, Chicago O'Hare airport has
\>338,000ft^2^ green roofs across 12 buildings. They retain up to 90%
precipitation (2 million gallons of stormwater annually), which help
double roof lifespans and save the airport USD1.5 million in re-roofing
costs [@AT2016].

Chicago O'Hare airport and Portland International Airport have
implemented grazing programmes, which avoid the use of motorised mowing
equipment and herbicides [@AT2016]. This provides cost savings to the
airport (e.g. by reducing the need for fuel and equipment), whilst
providing wider co-benefits including improved air quality, reduced
water contamination and reduced soil erosion.

London Heathrow Airport has piloted constructed treatment wetlands and
reed beds, to treat stormwater runoff and wastewater (see Figure 17.3.4)
[@Revitt&Brewer2001; @WWT2013].

wetland system to store and treat run-off and wastewater from the
airport. Photograph from @WWT2013.

Through the provision of services including regulation of air quality,
microclimate and noise, NbS can relieve passenger stress and offer
additional sector benefits by increasing airport loyalty
[@Trofimova2020; @Han2019]. For example, Portland international
Airport Terminal 4 has implemented a green wall consisting of \>20,000
species, which regulates temperature and improves air quality.
Furthermore, Singapore's Changi airport has incorporated various gardens
and NbS features (Figure 17.3.5) which has led to the airport being
considered a visitor attraction in its own right and has contributed to
Singapore's reputation as a city in a garden [@Henderson2017;
@Newman2013; @AT2016].

**Figure 17.3.5:** Singapore's Changi Airport includes multiple gardens
and an open dome to allow rainfall to be captured by an indoor waterfall
and forest, which provides cooling and energy savings to the airport,
saving the airport money whilst supporting regulation of the indoor
microclimate. Photograph from Unsplash.

## Integrating nature-based solutions into energy and digital transmission line networks

Transmission networks provide essential services to people, through
facilitating the transmission of electricity and communications. NbS can
support the delivery of these services through the protective services
that they offer, and by reducing the maintenance required by the sector.

For example, trees can be a major problem for energy network safety, as
they can interfere with transmission infrastructure. This is usually
managed by clearing vegetation through costly and frequent mulching and
manual cutting, which can exacerbate the problem through dispersing new
seedlings [@LifeElia2021; @EuropeanCommission]. NbS, such as the
creation of orchards, can reduce problematic tree species and
simultaneously safeguard rare species, attract pollinators and fauna,
and increase the aesthetic appeal of the landscape. Restoration of rare
habitats (e.g. peatlands, grasslands) or improved grazing management,
can provide similar benefits, and be compatible with electrical safety
due to their low height.

Planting or restoring thorny woodlands along the edges of electrical
transmission lines can help to deter encroachers if required, to provide
additional safety measures.

NbS can also help to increase public acceptance of energy transmission
line projects, by providing a series of benefits to the local community.

For example, the LIFE ELIA project has implemented NbS to demonstrate
how electricity transmission networks can reduce maintenance costs
through restoring peatlands and other habitats with low-lying vegetation
under power lines, whilst improving biodiversity (Figure 17.3.6). The
project was shown to break even in 3-12 years and become 1.4-3.9 times
cheaper (depending on the NbS) than traditional methods after 30 years
[@EuropeanCommission2019; @LifeElia2021; @LifeElia].

**Figure 17.3.6:** The LIFE ELIA project restored 130km of different
ecosystems in ecological corridors under overhead electricity
transmission networks (2011-2017). It delivered additional benefits
including pollination, carbon storage, increased amenity value

## Integrating nature-based solutions into the energy sector

While grey infrastructure solutions will continue to have a fundamental
role in the delivery of energy services going forward, NbS can
complement and enhance energy sector service delivery, and enable
electricity provision at lower cost [@Arias2011].

**Services to hydropower**

NbS can provide multiple benefits to hydropower electricity service
provision. For example, the restoration of forests and riparian
vegetation along water courses upstream from hydroelectric reservoirs
can ensure a regular supply of water, reduce sedimentation of
reservoirs, and thereby reduce dredging and maintenance requirements and
associated costs [@Stickler2013; @Kaura2019; @Guo2007].
Furthermore, by stabilising soils and preventing erosion, NbS can reduce
turbidity within reservoirs, leading to reduced downtime and protecting
the grey infrastructure asset from turbidity-induced wear and tear
(Figure 17.3.7) [@Browder2019].

through reducing erosion. Photograph from @Browder2019.

**Services to solar power**

By maintaining ecosystems, such as wetlands, around solar panels, energy
service providers can benefit from increased energy efficiency of solar
power generation, through the temperature regulating services that
ecosystems provide. Furthermore, the implementation of NbS in the form
of green roofs can enhance solar power service delivery, by acting as a
substrate to anchor solar panels and increasing their energy efficiency
by as much as 20% (Figure 17.3.8) [@Enzi2017; @Semeraro2020].

on green roofs, protect panels from weather impacts and support energy
efficiency. Photograph from @Enzi2017.

**Services to fixed assets**

The restoration, management or creation of new ecosystems around fixed
energy assets can protect grey infrastructure assets and safeguard
service delivery in a changing climate [@Semeraro2020].

## Summary

Built infrastructure networks, such as transport (road, rail, water and
air), energy and digital communications, typically rely on grey
infrastructure assets for service delivery. However, there are several
opportunities to leverage nature, through nature-based solutions, to
enhance the delivery of sector services. By integrating nature into
engineered networks, sectors can enhance service delivery, reduce
maintenance requirements, benefit from cost savings, whilst delivering
wider benefits for people, biodiversity and the environment.
