@report{GEF2018,
	abstract = {The GEF has a mandate to protect the global environmental commons-the biodiversity, water, oceans, healthy forests, land, and stable climate on which the planet and human health depend. Nowhere are the pressures on these resources more immediate than in Small Island Development States (SIDS), in view of their unique and particular vulnerability. SIDS, therefore, need enhanced and urgent action. At the same time, SIDS provide opportunities to lead the way and be a model for transformational change, such as transitioning to low carbon development pathways. Over more than 25 years the GEF has supported projects in critical areas for SIDS such as biodiversity protection, resilience to climate change and other shocks, increased energy access through renewable energy and energy efficiency, halting and reversing land degradation, cooperation on international waters, and improved chemicals management. In total, the GEF has provided more than US$578 million in country allocated finance across all focal areas. In addition, SIDS participated in a significant number of regional and global projects and programs that overall totaled an additional US$ 810 million. GEF finance has leveraged several times that amount in additional resources for sustainable development. The current GEF 7 funding cycle (2018-2022) continues to provide strong support and an emphasis on the needs of SIDS and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Partnerships The GEF represents a partnership among its member countries and 18 GEF agencies that implement GEF projects and programs. GEF funding serves as a catalyst that enables stakeholders to come together, including governments, development partners, global environmental conventions, intergovernmental institutions, non-governmental organizations and the private sector to support major projects and programs. These partnerships are designed from the outset to last far beyond the life of a single project and often have impacts far greater than originally anticipated. GEF's work aligns with the call for increased cooperation, partnerships, and support voiced, for example, in the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway, the Sendai Framework, and the Sustainable Development Goals, and supports the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. The size, remoteness, and limited natural resource base of SIDS means that successful development requires an integrated approach. While SIDS are confronted by obvious challenges, they also offer unique opportunities for innovation and transformational change at scale. Integrated approaches to the governance and management of land, water, forest, biodiversity, and coastal resources can contribute to enhanced livelihoods, reduce poverty, and increase resilience. The GEF is working with island countries in the Pacific, Africa, and the Caribbean to produce food sustainably, manage water responsibly, and produce energy efficiently, all while ensuring ecosystems remain intact through an ecosystems-based, integrated approach known as Ridge-to-Reef (R2R) which is blending GEF national and regional resources where appropriate. This approach is designed to reverse the degradation of coastal resources by finding ways to reduce the flow of untreated wastewater, chemicals, nutrients, and sediments from land-based agriculture, forestry, and cities into deltas, coastal zones, and oceans. Consequently, under a R2R approach, Integrated Water Resource Management and Integrated Coastal Management plans come together to inform long-term sustainable use of natural resources while limiting the impact on the fragile environment in SIDS and aiming for greater impact.},

@report{Khalequzzaman1994,
	abstract = {In recent years the frequency of abnormal floods in Bangladesh has increased substantially, causing serious damage to lives and property. The most crucial questions that need to be addressed are: what really causes the havoc-creating floods and is there any solution to the problem? The heavy monsoon downpour and synchronization of flood-peaks of the major rivers are generally considered to be the main causes of the floods. Some underlying factors also deserve serious consideration as possible contributors to the recent floods: change in the base level of the rivers due to local sea level rise and subsidence, inadequate sediment accumulation on flood plains, a possible increase in the watershed area due to seismic and neotectonic activities in the region, river bed aggradation due to siltation and damming of rivers, soil erosion due to unwise tilling practices, deforestation in the upstream region, and excessive development and population growth. Without regional cooperation among the co-riparian nations any major interbasin flood control activity is considered to be almost impossible. However, among other proposals in this paper, extensive annual dredging of the rivers, channels and creeks, and reoccupation of the abandoned channels in Bangladesh through re-excavations could still increase the water carrying capacity of the rivers. Land elevations could be increased if the dredged or excavated materials are dispersed on the flood plains, which would in turn reduce the severity of floods.},

This process increases erosion of embankments and water turbidity which bring the concerned sediments from alluvial land to the inland sides and river bed that further increase vertical soil accommodation and decrease the water depth. In this research geotechnical hazard analysis has been conducted based on the statistical riverine data and flood occurrence information, obtained from various recognized institutions and secondary literatures and scientific investigation of soil structural failures from field survey. The soil characteristics and existing conditions of the embankments of the three big rivers of Bangladesh-the Ganges, the Meghna, and the Brahmaputra-Jamuna, have been investigated. The research also includes the reasons behind the failure of different embankments that were happened in last decades. A design methodology has been proposed to make these embankments more durable and to improve the strength using a pre-designed methodological case study.},

@article{Stokes2014,
	abstract = {Background Plants alter their environment in a number of ways. With correct management, plant communities can positively impact soil degradation processes such as surface erosion and shallow landslides. However, there are major gaps in our understanding of physical and ecological processes on hillslopes, and the application of research to restoration and engineering projects. Scope To identify the key issues of concern to researchers and practitioners involved in designing and implementing projects to mitigate hillslope instability, we organized a discussion during the Third International Conference on Soil Bio-and Eco-Engineering: The Use of Vegetation to Improve Slope Stability, Vancouver, Canada, July 2012. The facilitators asked delegates to answer three questions: (i) what do practitioners need from science? (ii) what are some of the key knowledge gaps? (iii) what ideas do you have for future collaborative research projects between practitioners and researchers? From this discussion, ten key issues were identified, considered as the kernel of future studies concerning the impact of vegetation on slope stability and erosion processes. Each issue is described and a discussion at the end of this paper addresses how we can augment the use of ecological engineering techniques for mitigating slope instability. Conclusions We show that through fundamental and applied research in related fields (e.g., soil formation and biogeochemistry, hydrology and microbial ecology), reliable data can be obtained for use by practitioners seeking adapted solutions for a given site. Through fieldwork, accessible databases, modelling and collaborative projects, awareness and acceptance of the use of plant material in slope restoration projects should increase significantly, particularly in the civil and geotechnical communities.},

@article{Rahman2015,
	abstract = {Flood and riverbank erosion, two common hazards in Bangladesh, harshly affect many peoples' daily lives and damage their livelihoods. Livelihood resources (natural, physical, financial, human and social) can help cope with shocks and hazards. The objectives of the study were to identify which coping strategies and which livelihood resources were used in response to flood and erosion, and to judge how effective these strategies were. The area of study was the Sirajganj district of the Rajshahi division, across which runs the Brahmaputra river. Participatory Rapid Appraisal tools were used to collect data through a structured questionnaire survey. The data were processed by CRiSTAL software and analysed by Rep IV software. The data showed that riverbank erosion has a higher impact on people than flooding. The main strategies people use to cope with hazards include part-time work, rebuilding houses on an emergency basis, treating disease, taking temporary shelter on embankments and changing professions. The most effective coping strategy for flood and riverbank erosion was found to be doing part-time work. Physical and financial resources are the most effective means of coping with both hazards, while natural resources do not provide sufficient support. Social resources are comparatively more effective in helping people cope with riverbank erosion, as are human resources for flooding.},

In this paper, a mobile survey was conducted to explore both the severity of UHI effect and cooling impacts of green areas at macro-level in Singapore. Islandwide temperature distribution was mapped relying on data derived from the mobile survey. This study has indicated a strong correlation between the decrease of temperature and the appearance of large green areas in the city. Although there is no distinct borderline between 'urban' and 'rural' areas in Singapore, maximum temperature difference of 4.01$\,^{\circ}$C was observed. {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

These clusters are based on strategic sectors, for example urban geometry, transport and energy, and the physical aspects, such as albedo, shading and ventilation, which influence the urban climate. Each strategy describes its impact towards UHI and OTC, its applicability in the tropical context of Singapore, its integration into urban planning, and its current research status.

@article{Gill2007,
	abstract = {The urban environment has distinctive biophysical features in relation to surrounding rural areas. These include an altered energy exchange creating an urban heat island, and changes to hydrology such as increased surface runoff of rainwater. Such changes are, in part, a result of the altered surface cover of the urban area. For example less vegetated surfaces lead to a decrease in evaporative cooling, whilst an increase in surface sealing results in increased surface runoff. Climate change will amplify these distinctive features. This paper explores the important role that the green infrastructure, i.e. the greenspace network, of a city can play in adapting for climate change. It uses the conurbation of Greater Manchester as a case study site. The paper presents output from energy exchange and hydrological models showing surface temperature and surface runoff in relation to the green infrastructure under current and future climate scenarios. The implications for an adaptation strategy to climate change in the urban environment are discussed.},

	abstract = {The absence of vegetation in urban areas contributes to the establishment of the urban heat island, markedly increasing thermal stress for residents, driving morbidity and mortality. Mitigation strategies are, therefore, needed to reduce urban heat, particularly against a background of urbanization, anthropogenic warming and increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves. In this Review, we evaluate the potential of green infrastructure as a mitigation strategy, focusing on greenery on the ground (parks) and greenery on buildings (green roofs and green walls). Green infrastructure acts to cool the urban environment through shade provision and evapotranspiration. Typically, greenery on the ground reduces peak surface temperature by 2--9 $\,^{\circ}$C, while green roofs and green walls reduce surface temperature by ~17 $\,^{\circ}$C, also providing added thermal insulation for the building envelope. However, the cooling potential varies markedly, depending on the scale of interest (city or building level), greenery extent (park shape and size), plant selection and plant placement. Urban planners must, therefore, optimize design to maximize mitigation benefits, for example, by interspersing parks throughout a city, allocating more trees than lawn space and using multiple strategies in areas where most cooling is required. To do so, improved translation of scientific understanding to practical design guidelines is needed. The urban heat island effect poses increasing morbidity and mortality challenges in a warming world. This Review discusses how urban vegetation --- specifically, green parks, green roofs and green walls --- can be used as a strategy to mitigate heat.},

	abstract = {'Urban greening' has been proposed as one approach to mitigate the human health consequences of increased temperatures resulting from climate change. We used systematic review methodology to evaluate available evidence on whether greening interventions, such as tree planting or the creation of parks or green roofs, affect the air temperature of an urban area. Most studies investigated the air temperature within parks and beneath trees and are broadly supportive that green sites can be cooler than non-green sites. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize data on the cooling effect of parks and results show that, on average, a park was 0.94 $\,^{\circ}$C cooler in the day. Studies on multiple parks suggest that larger parks and those with trees could be cooler during the day. However, evidence for the cooling effect of green space is mostly based on observational studies of small numbers of green sites. The impact of specific greening interventions on the wider urban area, and whether the effects are due to greening alone, has yet to be demonstrated. The current evidence base does not allow specific recommendations to be made on how best to incorporate greening into an urban area. Further empirical research is necessary in order to efficiently guide the design and planning of urban green space, and specifically to investigate the importance of the abundance, distribution and type of greening. Any urban greening programme implemented would need to be appropriately designed and monitored to continue to evaluate benefit to human health through reducing temperature. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {More than three-quarters of the European population live in urban areas and this proportion is increasing, leading, in some cases, to increased vulnerability of cities to environmental hazards. The health impacts of heat waves are aggravated in cities due to the high density of buildings, the fragmentation of green areas and the higher concentrations of air pollutants. Ecosystems can provide important benefits that mitigate the impacts of heat waves but at the same time can themselves be affected by the hazard, thus limiting their services. The objective of this study was to assess the vulnerability of the Cologne urban population to heat waves, taking into consideration a range of social and ecological variables. Based on the MOVE framework, indicators were developed and GIS applications were used to spatially assess the relative vulnerability of the 85 districts of Cologne to heat waves. The insights gained were integrated and corroborated with the outcomes of stakeholders' interviews. As environmental factors play a major role in this assessment, it is suggested that ecosystem management in Cologne and its surroundings be improved. In addition, though vulnerability is higher in central districts, attention needs to be paid to the periphery where the most susceptible groups reside. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {<p>Urban heat is a growing environmental concern in cities around the world. The urban heat island effect, combined with warming effects of climate change, is likely to cause an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events. Alterations to the physical, built environment are a viable option for mitigating urban heat, yet few studies provide systematic guidance to practitioners for adapting diverse land uses. In this study, we examine the use of green infrastructure treatments to evaluate changes in ambient temperatures across diverse land uses in the city of Portland, Oregon. We apply ENVI-met{\textregistered} microclimate modeling at the city-block scale specifically to determine what built environment characteristics are most associated with high temperatures, and the extent to which different physical designs reduce ambient temperature. The analysis included six green infrastructure interventions modeled across six different land-use types, and indicated the varying degrees to which approaches are effective. Results were inconsistent across landscapes, and showed that one mitigation solution alone would not significantly reduce extreme heat. These results can be used to develop targeted, climate- and landscape-specific cooling interventions for different land uses, which can help to inform and refine current guidance to achieve urban climate adaptation goals.</p>},
