abstract = {Rapid urbanisation worldwide has created a host of fundamental challenges, which in conjunction with natural or man-made disasters, now threaten the resilience of communities, cities, and mega-cities. Consider the first challenge of climate change which has undermined the fundamental assumptions used to design the engineered systems that currently define the critical functionalities of cities today, and for tomorrow will demand innovative paradigms and new assumptions for designing resilient cities of the future. Another challenge concerns the damages directly or indirectly associated with natural and man-made disasters. These damages are expected to escalate as long as the value at risk continues to increase. And then there is the challenge of surging connectivity within and between critical infrastructure systems which has left such systems interdependent and vulnerable to cascading failures and regime shifts which foment ill-defined changes in system functionality. Changes that include but are not limited to emergent disruptions of critical services, system damages and even system-wide failures. The purpose of this chapter is to propose a framework for understanding and assessing critical infrastructure system resilience, to introduce a vision of resilient governance, and to propose a framework for harnessing knowledge transfer and continuous learning as required of policymakers seeking to elucidate and promote best practices that shape desired behaviour from individuals, social systems, stakeholders and communities. Significant findings are the following. First, a set of 10 questions (deca-tuple set) is formulated to frame resilience assessment and management concepts. The approach taken is analogous to that of the triplet-question set of risk management. The deca-tuple question set serves to guide the work of resilience evaluation and analysis and even resilience building. The process of building resilience is, in fact, a collective action of public and private stakeholders responding to infrastructure disruptions. We propose a resilience assessment framework consisting of 5 phases: pre-assessment, appraisal, characterization and evaluation, management and communication. This framework follows that of the risk governance framework of the International Risk Governance Council (IRGC). Building resilience requires continuous learning and adaptation from individuals, teams, organisations, governance and government systems. We propose three levels: knowledge transformation for policymaking, building best practices, and adapting individual behaviour. Authors identified several knowledge gaps for future scientific investigation in the domains of: context and framing, disruption identification, biophysical resilience analysis, cognitive resilience analysis, resilience evaluation, and building system resilience.},

abstract = {Emergencies are a fact of life throughout the world and can take many forms. In the UK, we are fortunate that our environment and climate are relatively calm and stable, but we still face some risks that could cause serious disruption to peoples' day to day lives. Alongside emergency services and local authorities, the Government has an important role to play in identifying, assessing, preparing for and dealing with emergencies, from flooding and severe storms to industrial accidents or terrorist attacks. In addition to everything the emergency services and other authorities do to manage risks, there are also sensible precautions that you can take to help protect yourself. These include being aware of risks and understanding what you can do individually, or as part of your business or community to prepare for them. There are some events that could cause widespread damage and would require some form of Government response. The Government produces this document, the National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies (NRR) to give information to the public about these risks, alongside advice and guidance on how you can prepare for them. The NRR is based on information from the National Risk Assessment, which is a classified assessment of risks that could happen in the UK over the next five years. Both products help the Government and local authorities to inform, plan and prepare.},

abstract = {Temporary employment has become a focus of policy debate, theory, and research. This book addresses the relationship between temporary employment contracts and employee well-being. It does so within the analytic framework of the psychological contract, and advances theory and knowledge about the psychological contract by exploring it from a variety of perspectives. It also sets the psychological contract within the context of a range of other potential influences on work-related well-being including workload, job insecurity, employability, and organizational support. The book identifies the relative importance of these various potential influences on well-being, covering seven countries; Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the UK, as well as Israel as a comparator outside Europe. The book's conclusions are interesting and controversial. The central finding is that contrary to expectations, temporary workers report higher well-being than permanent workers. As expected, a range of factors help to explain variations in work-related well-being and the research highlights the important role of the psychological contract. However, even after taking into account alternative explanations, the significant influence of type of employment contract remains, with temporary workers reporting higher well-being. In addition to this core finding, by exploring several aspects of the psychological contract, and taking into account both employer and employee perspectives, the book sheds light on the nature and role of the psychological contract. It also raises some challenging policy questions and while acknowledging the potentially precarious nature of temporary jobs, highlights the need to consider the increasingly demanding nature of permanent jobs and their effects on the well-being of employees.},

abstract = {Results from the first statistically significant study of the causes of cost escalation in transport infrastructure projects are presented. The study is based on a sample of 258 rail, bridge, tunnel and road projects worth US$90 billion. The focus is on the dependence of cost escalation on: (1) the length of the project‐implementation phase, (2) the size of the project and (3) the type of project ownership. First, it was found, with very high statistical significance, that cost escalation was strongly dependent on the length of the implementation phase. The policy implications are clear: decision‐makers and planners should be highly concerned about delays and long implementation phases because they translate into risks of substantial cost escalations. Second, projects have grown larger over time, and for bridges and tunnels larger projects have larger percentage cost escalations. Finally, by comparing the cost escalation for three types of project ownership—private, state‐owned enterprise and other public ownership—it was shown that the oft‐seen claim that public ownership is problematic and private ownership effective in curbing cost escalation is an oversimplification. The type of accountability appears to matter more to cost escalation than type of ownership. {\textcopyright} 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

The WGI has covered over two hundred countries and territories, measuring six dimensions of governance starting in 1996: Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption. The aggregate indicators are based on several hundred individual underlying variables, taken from a wide variety of existing data sources. The data reflect the views on governance of survey respondents and public, private, and NGO sector experts worldwide. We also explicitly report margins of error accompanying each country estimate. These reflect the inherent difficulties in measuring governance using any kind of data. We find that even after taking margins of error into account, the WGI permit meaningful cross-country and over-time comparisons. The aggregate indicators, together with the disaggregated underlying source data, are available at www.govindicators.org.},

@techreport{Rozenberg2019,
abstract = {Beyond the Gap: How Countries Can Afford the Infrastructure They Need while Protecting the Planet aims to shift the debate regarding investment needs away from a simple focus on spending more and toward a focus on spending better on the right objectives, using relevant metrics. It does so by offering a careful and systematic approach to estimating the funding needs to close the service gaps in water and sanitation, transportation, electricity, irrigation, and flood protection. Exploring thousands of scenarios, this report finds that funding needs depend on the service goals and policy choices of low- and middle-income countries and could range anywhere from 2 percent to 8 percent of GDP per year by 2030. Beyond the Gap also identifies a policy mix that will enable countries to achieve key international goals—universal access to water, sanitation, and electricity; greater mobility; improved food security; better protection from floods; and eventual full decarbonization—while limiting spending on new infrastructure to 4.5 percent of GDP per year. Importantly, the exploration of thousands of scenarios shows that infrastructure investment paths compatible with full decarbonization in the second half of the century need not cost more than more-polluting alternatives. Investment needs remain at 2 percent to 8 percent of GDP even when only the decarbonized scenarios are examined. The actual amount depends on the quality and quantity of services targeted, the timing of investments, construction costs, and complementary policies. Finally, investing in infrastructure is not enough; maintaining it also matters. Improving services requires much more than capital expenditure. Ensuring a steady flow of resources for operations and maintenance is a necessary condition for success. Good maintenance also generates substantial savings by reducing the total life-cycle cost of transport and water and sanitation infrastructure by more than 50 percent.},

@book{Moore2018,
abstract = {The prospect of international conflict over water has long been the subject of academic and popular concern, but subnational political conflict is considerably more common, and almost certainly imposes greater economic and environmental costs. Indeed, subnational hydropolitics are an important feature of several large countries, including the United States, India, and China. Moreover, disputes between water users in shared river basins have often persisted despite repeated attempts by central governments to resolve them through both persuasion and coercion. Yet despite the growing threat of water scarcity around the world, little research exists on sub-national politics of shared water resources. This book attempts to fill the gap by explaining how and why hydropolitics play out within countries, as well as between them.Subnational Hydropolitics\ re-examines the issue of water conflict by examining conflicts at the subnational rather than international level. By examining several in-depth case studies of both conflict and cooperation, author Scott Moore argues that increasing sub-national water conflict is driven by two inter-linked forces, identity politics, which gives subnational politicians a reason to compete over shared water resources; and political decentralization, which provides them with the tools to do so. To understand politics at the subnational level, the book blends insights from both the environmental governance and comparative politics literatures. By examining the challenges many countries face in achieving cooperation over shared water resources, the book helps to shed light on different mechanisms and processes for solving cooperation problems at the regional scale lessons relevant to tackling a wide range of transboundary environmental problems, including air pollution, urbanization, and ecosystem protection. But at its core, this book promises a definitive contribution to the growing sub-field of environmental politics, centered on understanding how different countries attempt to solve the problems inherent in governing water resources in shared river basins.},

Significant challenges in measuring resilience, however, contribute to both a tendency towards imperfect quantified metrics, and a quest for universal resilience indicators that can be aggregated across projects, institutions, and geographies. In this paper, we draw from lessons across various sectors typically outside of the traditional resilience and climate risk management realm to highlight potential pitfalls and unintended consequences of such metrics. We then discuss several “thought experiments” to identify the desired characteristics development practitioners would want projects to demonstrate, but for which there exist risks for imperfect aggregated indicators to create perverse incentives. Process-based metrics that focus on the quality of a project's design and implementation are more likely to avoid these pitfalls and should be considered a viable alternative to aggregated universal resilience indicators.},

An SLO can be defined as a contractarian basis for the legitimacy of a company's specific activity or project. “SLO”, as a fashionable expression, has its origins in business practice. From a normative viewpoint, the concept is closely related to social contract theory, and, as such, it has a political dimension. After outlining the contractarian normative background to the SLO, we will show how academic concepts such as legitimacy and stakeholder management have a tendency to provide the intellectual underpinning for the business case for securing an SLO. While business case perspectives on the SLO may well be in line with the use of the term in business practice, we will highlight certain difficulties and ambiguities related to the instrumental use of the expression.

abstract = {This paper examines some of the critiques addressed to participatory development by critics such as Cooke and Kothari. It argues that criticisms of participation's theoretical coherence and of its lapse into a routinised praxis largely arise from an unavoidable ambiguity that is inherent in the concept of participation, this being the means/end ambiguity. Participation must function as a means because any development project must produce some outputs (therefore participation is seen as a means to achieve such outputs), but it must also function as an end inasmuch as empowerment is viewed as a necessary outcome. This ambiguity becomes contradictory when emphasis is laid on participation as a means at the expense of participation as an end. The article proposes ways of re-emphasising the element of empowerment so that participation may function as an emancipatory strategy.},
