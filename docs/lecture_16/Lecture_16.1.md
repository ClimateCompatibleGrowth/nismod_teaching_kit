This lecture illustrates how nature-based solutions can be used to
regulate and manage extreme water events, such as floods and droughts. A
range of nature-based options for fluvial, pluvial and tidal flooding
and drought are provided, and case studies are presented where
applications of these can be seen in practice.

# Learning objectives 

-   To identify a portfolio of nature-based solutions for water
    regulation in extreme situations of flooding and drought
-   To illustrate how nature-based solutions have been used in
    conjunction with hard infrastructure to regulate flood extremes
-   To recognise the value of nature-based solutions in adapting to and
    mitigating water extremes.

 

# Introduction to regulation of water extremes

It is widely acknowledged that climate change is expected to increase
the magnitude, frequency and duration of extreme weather. At present, an
estimated 4 billion people live in areas of water scarcity
[@Damania2017] and approximately 2.3 billion people are affected by
flooding [@GEF2018]. These figures are expected to rise in the face
of climate change. Appropriate water regulation underpins the majority
of the SDGs (1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17).

In the past, hard engineering structures such as flood walls,
embankments, canals, reservoirs and drainage pipes have mitigated the
impacts of climate extremes. But, under a changing climate, such
infrastructure is now being tested like never before. Nature is able to
adapt itself to changing environmental conditions, and therefore
nature-based solutions have become more attractive for sustainable
development and longer-term climate resilience. Figure 16.1.1 summarises
some of the key nature-based solutions available for water management
purposes. As shown, the fundamental concept that underpins nature-based
solutions in water management is to mimic the inherent natural water
cycle as much as possible.

[@Cohen-Shacham2016]

In this lecture, we look into the natural options available for
regulating flooding in rivers, coasts and urban settings, and use a case
study to show how such options have been applied in real life.
Similarly, the other extreme side of the spectrum---drought---is
described, with a real-life example of nature-based solutions for
drought management outlined.

# Nature-based solutions for flood regulation

Floodplains are amongst the most productive ecosystems. Traditional
engineered solutions have often disconnected floodplains from their
rivers or tidal channels, and have contributed to a great loss of
ecosystem services from these systems [@Bertule2014]. Nature-based
solutions allow these ecosystems to thrive, and also offer flexibility
and adaptability to further environmental change that built solutions do
not provide [@Kapos2019]. Due to the complexity of natural systems,
these alternative solutions typically address multiple climate
challenges at once and can generate larger economic returns because of
the co-benefits they create [@Kapos2019]. For instance, by restoring
upland forests and watersheds to reduce peak flows and stabilise soils
in river systems could save water treatment utilities across the world's
largest cities an estimated USD890 million each year [@McDonald2014;
@Kapos2019] (see Figure 16.1.2).

Table 16.1.1 identifies engineered and nature-based solutions for the
three flood types (fluvial, pluvial and tidal) and highlights some of
the co-benefits that these alternative solutions provide.

As evident from the table, nature-based solutions can protect,
complement, or substitute flood risk management infrastructure, and
reduce the need for such measures [@Kapos2019]. In coastal regions,
for instance, salt marshes can reduce non-storm wave heights by an
average of 72%, coral and oyster reef systems by 70%, mangroves by 31%
and seagrass by 36% [@Kapos2019]. It can be two to five times cheaper
to restore coastal wetlands and reef systems than to construct submerged
breakwaters, which can significantly alleviate the financial burden of
such infrastructure measures on some developing countries.

# Nature-based solutions for flood regulation: Case study in China

The concept of a "Sponge City" was introduced by the Chinese Central
Government in 2013, in response to the increasing flood impacts
inundating 234 cities across the country that year [@Hall2019]. The
approach has challenged the traditional management approach of
discharging stormwater runoff and avoiding inundation, and changed it to
inviting and utilising stormwater as much as possible. Through the use
of rainwater harvesting, permeable pavements, open green spaces, green
roofs and water recycling, these sponge cities aim to collect, store,
purify and use 70% of rainwater across 80% of the urban area by 2030.
The application of this concept is evident in Figure 16.1.2, and has
been applied to 16 pilot cities.

Jinhuan City is a prime example of a successful sponge city, with the
completion of Jinhua Yanwei Island Park in 2014. The design made use of
former sand quarries, planting native wetland species on water-resilient
terraced river embankments. The monsoon floods would act as the natural
seasonal fertilizer, by depositing silt and nutrients over the terraces.
The paved areas are also entirely permeable through extensive use of
gravel from the previous quarry and permeable paving [@Hall2019].

The sponge city concept is a great example where urban design aims to
mimic the natural environmental processes and provides space for these
to occur.

# Nature-based solutions for drought regulation

Droughts have wide-reaching environmental, social and economic impacts,
ranging from famine and human mortality, to losses in agriculture and
deaths of livestock and wildlife [@Kapos2019]. There is significantly
less of an evidence-base and scientific focus on the potential of
nature-based solutions for drought management. Examples of nature-based
solutions for managing water demand (e.g. reducing crop water
requirements in irrigation) exist, yet most natural solutions focus on
addressing water supply through improved management of water storage,
infiltration and transmission. This enables the timing, quantity and
quality of water to be optimised for human-related needs
[@UnitedNations2018].

Some natural solutions for addressing impacts of drought are presented
in 16.1.2. As is clear in the table, nature-based solutions for droughts
are centred around improving the soil quality and vegetation to enhance
groundwater recharge. This is due to the soil-vegetation interface
acting as the key determinant of the fate of precipitation, whether it
is able to infiltrate into the land surface and recharge groundwater or
not [@UnitedNations2018]. If the groundwater is appropriately
recharged, water availability will increase during times of reduced
rainfall. In addition, restoring "Green Belts" of native vegetation will
also provide shade to water bodies, allowing more water to infiltrate
into the soil as less is evaporated.

These nature-based solutions can also be used alongside small-scale grey
infrastructure, to create hybrid approaches. For instance, creating
small depressions for water harvesting or extracting underexploited
water in landscapes can also relieve water stress. These hybrid
approaches should complement one another and harness synergies in
relieving drought conditions [@UnitedNations2018].

# Nature-based solutions for drought regulation: Case study in India

In 1985-1986, the State of Rajasthan in north-west India experienced
unusually low rainfall, which, combined with excessive logging, led to
the worst drought in the history of this region. The groundwater receded
below critical levels, with some areas across the State being declared
as "dark zones" -- zones that restricted any further groundwater
abstraction.

Tarun Bharat Sangh, a local non-governmental organisation (NGO),
supported communities to undertake landscape-scale restoration of
natural water storages and transfers. Activities were led by women and
were centred around the constructed of small-scale water harvesting
structures and the regeneration of forests and soils, particularly in
the upper catchments. This was done in order to improve the recharge of
groundwater resources locally and also further downstream
[@UnitedNations2018].

The outcomes of this management approach have been impressive. Water was
brought back to over 1,000 villages across the State, surface water is
flowing again in five rivers that used to run dry after the monsoon
season, and fisheries have been re-established. The improved groundwater
recharge has resulted in groundwater levels rising by an estimated six
metres, allowing productive farmland to prosper (increasing from 20% to
80% of the catchment). Finally, critical forest cover that is
maintaining the integrity and water-retaining capacity of the soil has
increased by 33%, which has simultaneously also provided a home for more
antelopes and leopards [@UnitedNations2018].

This case study shows how when humans adapt to the natural environment,
allowing it to operate over its natural cycles without interference, the
benefits experienced can be vast.

# Summary 

This mini-lecture has provided an introduction to nature-based solutions
for regulating water extremes. A portfolio of options has been provided
for both regulating floods and droughts, and case studies have
demonstrated how such natural solutions have succeeded in practice.
