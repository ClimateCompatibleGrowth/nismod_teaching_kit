	abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400--1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 $\,^{\circ}$C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the SSP narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.},

The article reconstructs the evolution of IAMs and their changing role in this interface, investigating how and why IAMs have become so prominent. Based on literature analysis, quantitative document analysis and semi-structured interviews, we describe the historic evolution of the interactions between IAMs and policy-making between 1970 and 2015. We identify five historic phases in which IAMs played distinct mediating roles between science and policy, succeeding to adjust their scenario efforts to the continuously changing demands for knowledge from the policy community. In explaining the prominent role of IAMs, we differentiate between background conditions (material and sociological) and more contextual factors, most notably the flexible, hybrid and broad nature of IAMs as well as the pro-active character of the IAM community to enhance their policy relevance. We draw on the notion of institutional work to explain this success. In light of the urgency of responding to the climate crisis, we suggest that the IAM community may expand their scope of anticipated futures and consider engaging a wider range of publics and societal stakeholders beyond the science-policy interface.},

Here we propose a conceptual framework for how to define and develop a set of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) for use within the scenario framework. We define SSPs as reference pathways describing plausible alternative trends in the evolution of society and ecosystems over a century timescale, in the absence of climate change or climate policies. We introduce the concept of a space of challenges to adaptation and to mitigation that should be spanned by the SSPs, and discuss how particular trends in social, economic, and environmental development could be combined to produce such outcomes. A comparison to the narratives from the scenarios developed in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) illustrates how a starting point for developing SSPs can be defined. We suggest initial development of a set of basic SSPs that could then be extended to meet more specific purposes, and envision a process of application of basic and extended SSPs that would be iterative and potentially lead to modification of the original SSPs themselves. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

@booksection{Thoung2016,
	abstract = {Introduction: The nature and scale of demand for national infrastructure services is driven by long-term changes in population, the economy, technology, society and the environment. However, how those factors affect the longer-term demand for infrastructure is not straightforward. Investment in infrastructure will be challenged by a number of fundamental long-term trends that include demographic developments (e.g. ageing and urbanisation), increasing constraints on public finances, environmental factors (climate change), technological progress (especially in the area of information and communication technology), trends in governance (particularly decentralisation), an expanding role for the private sector and an increasing need to maintain and upgrade existing infrastructures (OECD, 2007). Chapter 1 highlighted the relationship between infrastructure and the economy. However, the causation between infrastructure availability, economic growth and productivity remains subject to much uncertainty because the relationships between infrastructure and the economy are multiple and complex (Kessides, 1993; Serven, 1996; O'Fallon, 2003; Prud'Homme, 2004; Bourguignon and Pleskovic, 2005; Straub, 2011). Moreover, it is not necessarily generally the case that growth in the economy and population results in increasing demand for infrastructure services. For example, in the transport sector the notion of `peak car' (Le Vine et al., 2009; Millard-Ball and Schipper, 2010), asserts that car ownership and usage may have plateaued (Chapter 5); and, the quantity of solid waste which needs to be dealt with by infrastructure has been decoupled from economic growth over time (Chapter 8). Nonetheless, it is clear that a growing population and economy are important factors that influence demand for infrastructure services, even while the relationship between these underlying factors and demand is changing. Moreover, it is not just aggregate demand that is relevant when we are thinking about the future of infrastructure systems. The spatial patterns of demand are highly relevant to infrastructure needs at particular locations thereby influencing network configuration. The structure of the economy also influences the nature of demand, as does the demographic structure of the population, for example, age and gender distribution. Some insight into how the demand for infrastructure has changed in the past can be gained by considering the experience of Britain's road and energy networks. There has been a dramatic increase in user demand for road space over the last sixty years: in the mid-1950s road travel was around 60 billion vehicle kilometres per year, but by 2010 this had increased to nearly 500 billion vehicle kilometres per year (DfT, 2010).},

	abstract = {This paper analyses urban waste systems to explore how local authorities can resolve challenges related to climate change, urbanization and resource depletion. The paper investigates how different public governance regimes affect local authorities' ability to move upwards in the waste hierarchy. It identifies three different governance regimes -- traditional bureaucracy, new public management and networked governance -- and uses the insights from innovation in urban waste in three Norwegian city regions -- Oslo, Drammen and Bergen -- to illuminate how these regimes possess both strengths and weaknesses in how they affect system optimization and system change. The observed working practices signal that the issue of urban waste systems is perceived as a challenge of system optimization rather than system change. Viewing this as a challenge requiring system change would probably have ensured a stronger directionality and a broader anchoring of actors. Such an approach is likely to have arrived at a waste prevention mode earlier than the step-by-step-solutions implemented so far. The paper concludes that there is not one best governance regime, but a need to acknowledge their co-existence and carefully consider the characteristics of the respective regimes in order to arrange urban waste systems for long-term dynamic and sustainable city regions.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Universal, affordable and clean energy is a prerequisite for economic and social development. Addressing global challenges from poverty eradication to food security, essential healthcare to peace, and from ecosystems conservation to security requires greater access to modern energy. Almost all goods and services have energy implications: from the foods we consume, the buildings we live and work in, vehicles we use and the day-to-day consumables at home and work -- all require energy. With the current fossil fuel dominant global energy mix, energy use worldwide is responsible for ∼60% of global CO2 emissions. This also makes the energy system central to mitigation and management of anthropogenic climate change. It is estimated that in order to transform the energy system to address its current challenges with existing and emerging technologies, investments in the order of ∼$45 trillion will be required by 2050 (OECD, 2012). Given the reliance of long-lived assets, path dependency and the size and complexity of the energy system, acting earlier and with a long-term and holistic approach will ensure that these investments will be cheaper and more effective to deliver long-term sustainable, effective and affordable energy systems. Now, with industrialisation and economic development occurring at break-neck speed in high-population emerging economies, global energy demand hotspots and trends are once again changing rapidly, with the share of non-OECD countries' energy consumption surpassing OECD countries' in recent years (from 36% in 1973 to 57% in 2011). Non-OECD countries' share is set to grow further to ∼65% by 2035 (IEA, 2013) driven by increasing population, urbanisation and income, key drivers of energy demand in that part of the world. Global population is expected to increase from the current 7 billion to 8.3 billion by 2030, with 90% of the growth in low and medium income countries outside the OECD. The current trend of industrialisation, urbanisation and motor vehicle growth in developing and emerging economies will continue, leading to more than an 80% increase in energy use worldwide in a business-as-usual scenario (IEA, 2012). Demands in power generation and industry are projected to dominate, accounting for 57% and 25% growth in primary energy consumption by 2030, respectively (BP, 2010). Between 2011 and 2035, China is projected to account for ∼30% of net demand growth followed by India (18%), SE Asia (11%), Mid-East (10%) and Africa (8%), {\ldots}},

	abstract = {Introduction: This chapter considers the challenges facing national transport infrastructure systems now and in the future. It introduces the wide range of issues which are currently facing such systems around the world, before considering how future changes in demand for such systems can be modelled, based on a case study of Britain. The development of a new model of Britain's transport system is described, followed by a discussion of the results produced by this model when used to predict the impact of a set of potential future transport strategies under a range of external conditions. Finally, the policy implications of these results are discussed along with the potential impacts of interdependencies with other infrastructure systems. For the purposes of this chapter, national transport infrastructure systems are defined as comprising the road and rail networks along with all major airports and seaports. While the vehicles which operate on this infrastructure are not usually considered to form part of the infrastructure system, they are nonetheless crucial, as changes in factors such as vehicle efficiency and fuels will be key in determining levels of impacts such as carbon emissions, as well as the demands on other sectors, particularly energy. A significant proportion of transport infrastructure currently experiences congestion for at least part of the day, with the peaks caused by large numbers of people travelling to school and work with short arrival windows placing particular pressure on capacity. A key challenge for transport planners is therefore finding ways to address this congestion and its detrimental effects on the economy and the environment. This is linked to the question of whether it is possible to accommodate existing and predicted traffic on the existing infrastructure system by increasing the efficiency of its operation, or whether the construction of additional infrastructure is required. It seems inevitable that at least some additional construction will be necessary to address key pinch points, but the latent traffic phenomenon means that this will not necessarily reduce congestion (Goodwin, 1996). While growth in the demand for travel by some modes (notably the car) has been levelling off in recent years (see Figure 5.1), the substantial population growth predicted in coming decades means that total travel demand will almost certainly increase even if travel per person is static or declining.},

@booksection{Watson2016,
	abstract = {Introduction: Wastes are defined in the Waste Framework Directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2008) as `any substance or object which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard'. Over the last two to three decades, waste management in the industrialised world has gradually shifted from providing safe disposal of unwanted materials, often by entombing the waste in a sophisticated, engineered landfill, to recovering materials and value from that which is no longer needed through reuse, recycling, composting and energy recovery. In Britain, this shift has resulted in a 71% reduction in the amount of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) going to landfill since 1995. Recycling and composting have increased from almost nothing in 1995 to nearly 45% of municipal waste treatment today and energy from wastes accounts for about a third of renewable energy generated (Defra, 2015a). This has required significant investment in infrastructure as well as sustained efforts to change the attitude of industry and consumers. Recent publications on resource security (Defra, 2012), resource efficiency (European Commission, 2011) and sustainable materials management (OECD, 2012) show that there is a move away from the linear view of resource management (extraction, manufacture, use, final disposal) towards a more circular view in which waste management becomes primarily a resource recovery operation and final disposal is necessary only for those materials from which further value can no longer be economically or technically extracted. Material and value are recovered from wastes through recycling and composting (42%) and energy recovery (22%) with the remainder being landfilled (34%). (Figures are from Defra for 2012/2013 and are for local authority collected waste (LACW) in England.) Recycling accounts for most of this recovery and the rates for the most commonly collected materials (glass, steel, aluminium, dense plastics (e.g. plastic bottles) and paper, card and cardboard) are shown in Table 8.1. Garden wastes are recovered for composting and food or mixed food and garden wastes for in-vessel composting (IVC) or anaerobic digestion (AD). Other materials (e.g. tetrapaks and plastic film) are recovered more rarely. Energy is generally recovered by incineration from mixed wastes, from mixed wastes processed to produce fuels (solid recovered fuel (SRF) or refuse derived fuel (RDF)) for co-combustion or through the AD of biodegradable wastes (usually food waste or mixed food and green waste).},

	abstract = {The increase in the consumption of animal products is likely to put further pressure on the world's freshwater resources. This paper provides a comprehensive account of the water footprint of animal products, considering different production systems and feed composition per animal type and country. Nearly one-third of the total water footprint of agriculture in the world is related to the production of animal products. The water footprint of any animal product is larger than the water footprint of crop products with equivalent nutritional value. The average water footprint per calorie for beef is 20 times larger than for cereals and starchy roots. The water footprint per gram of protein for milk, eggs and chicken meat is 1. 5 times larger than for pulses. The unfavorable feed conversion efficiency for animal products is largely responsible for the relatively large water footprint of animal products compared to the crop products. Animal products from industrial systems generally consume and pollute more ground- and surface-water resources than animal products from grazing or mixed systems. The rising global meat consumption and the intensification of animal production systems will put further pressure on the global freshwater resources in the coming decades.

	abstract = {The aim of current European Union waste management directives is to promote prevention of waste and the application of a waste management hierarchy: preparing for reuse, recycling, other recovery, and disposal. The Waste Framework Directive only measures the waste operations recycling, incineration, and landfill individually, not measuring the implementation of the waste hierarchy principle in Member States of the European Union. The present study proposes a waste hierarchy index (WHI) to measure the waste hierarchy within a circular economy context, applied to municipal solid waste. In developing the WHI, recycling and preparing for reuse, as defined by Eurostat, were considered as positive contributors to the circular economy, and incineration and landfill as negative contributors. The WHI was applied at different geographic scales (local and national levels) to verify its potential and limitations. The WHI is a direct and concise indicator that provides a holistic perspective on how waste is being managed. The WHI is more than a source of waste statistics; it is the beginning of a real discussion about how waste statistics should be managed to reach a circular economy through the implementation of waste hierarchy.},

@article{Lempert2010,
	abstract = {Climate change presents a significant planning challenge for water management agencies in the western United States. Changing precipitation and temperature patterns will disrupt their supply and extensive distribution systems over the coming decades, but the precise timing and extent of these impacts remain deeply uncertain, complicating decisions on needed investments in infrastructure and other system improvements. Adaptive strategies represent an obvious solution in principle, but are often difficult to develop and implement in practice. This paper describes work helping the Inland Empire Utilities Agency (IEUA) explicitly develop adaptive policies to respond to climate change and integrating these policies into the organizations' long-range planning processes. The analysis employs Robust Decision Making (RDM), a quantitative decision- analytic approach for supporting decisions under conditions of deep uncertainty. RDM studies use simulation models to assess the performance of agency plans over thousands of plausible futures, use statistical "scenario discovery" algorithms to concisely summarize those futures where the plans fail to perform adequately, and use these resulting scenarios to help decisionmakers understand the vulnerabilities of their plans and assess the options for ameliorating these vulnerabilities. This paper demonstrates the particular value of RDM in helping decisionmakers to design and evaluate adaptive strategies. For IEUA, the RDM analysis suggests the agency's current plan could perform poorly and lead to high shortage and water provisioning costs under conditions of: (1) large declines in precipitation, (2) larger-than-expected impacts of climate change on the availability of imported supplies, and (3) reductions in percolation of precipitation into the region's groundwater basin. Including adaptivity in the current plan eliminates 72% of the high-cost outcomes. Accelerating efforts in expanding the size of one of the agency's groundwater banking programs and implementing its recycling program, while monitoring the region's supply and demand balance and making additional investments in efficiency and storm-water capture if shortages are projected provides one promising robust adaptive strategy - it eliminates more than 80% of the initially-identified high-cost outcomes. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Urich2014,
	abstract = {Long-term projections for key drivers needed in urban water infrastructure planning such as climate change, population growth, and socio-economic changes are deeply uncertain. Traditional planning approaches heavily rely on these projections, which, if a projection stays unfulfilled, can lead to problematic infrastructure decisions causing high operational costs and/or lock-in effects. New approaches based on exploratory modelling take a fundamentally different view. Aim of these is, to identify an adaptation strategy that performs well under many future scenarios, instead of optimising a strategy for a handful. However, a modelling tool to support strategic planning to test the implication of adaptation strategies under deeply uncertain conditions for urban water management does not exist yet. This paper presents a first step towards a new generation of such strategic planning tools, by combing innovative modelling tools, which coevolve the urban environment and urban water infrastructure under many different future scenarios, with robust decision making. The developed approach is applied to the city of Innsbruck, Austria, which is spatially explicitly evolved 20 years into the future under 1000 scenarios to test the robustness of different adaptation strategies. Key findings of this paper show that: (1) Such an approach can be used to successfully identify parameter ranges of key drivers in which a desired performance criterion is not fulfilled, which is an important indicator for the robustness of an adaptation strategy; and (2) Analysis of the rich dataset gives new insights into the adaptive responses of agents to key drivers in the urban system by modifying a strategy.},

	abstract = {This paper explores potential future implications of climate change on building energy expenditures around the globe. Increasing expenditures result from increased electricity use for cooling, and are offset to varying degrees, depending on the region, by decreased energy consumption for heating. The analysis is conducted using a model of the global buildings sector within the GCAM integrated assessment model. The integrated assessment framework is valuable because it represents socioeconomic and energy system changes that will be important for understanding building energy expenditures in the future. Results indicate that changes in net expenditures are not uniform across the globe. Net expenditures decrease in some regions, such as Canada and Russia, where heating demands currently dominate, and increase the most in areas with less demand for space heating and greater demand for space cooling. We explain these results in terms of the basic drivers that link building energy expenditures to regional climate.},

	abstract = {Wind and solar power have experienced rapid cost declines and are being deployed at scale. However, their output variability remains a key problem for managing electricity systems, and the implications of multi-day to multi-year variability are still poorly understood. As other energy-using sectors are electrified, the shape and variability of electricity demand will also change. We develop an open framework for quantifying the impacts of weather on electricity supply and demand using the Renewables.ninja and DESSTINEE models. We demonstrate this using a case study of Britain using National Grid's Two Degrees scenario forwards to 2030. We find the British electricity system is rapidly moving into unprecedented territory, with peak demand rising above 70 GW due to electric heating, and intermittent renewable output exceeding demand as early as 2021. Hourly ramp-rates widen by 50% and year-to-year variability increases by 80%, showing why future power system studies must consider multiple years of data, and the influence of weather on both supply and demand. Our framework is globally applicable, and allows detailed scenarios of hourly electricity supply and demand to be explored using only limited input data such as annual quantities from government scenarios or broader energy systems models.},

@article{Haasnoot2013,
	abstract = {A new paradigm for planning under conditions of deep uncertainty has emerged in the literature. According to this paradigm, a planner should create a strategic vision of the future, commit to short-term actions, and establish a framework to guide future actions. A plan that embodies these ideas allows for its dynamic adaptation over time to meet changing circumstances. We propose a method for decisionmaking under uncertain global and regional changes called 'Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways'. We base our approach on two complementary approaches for designing adaptive plans: 'Adaptive Policymaking' and 'Adaptation Pathways'. Adaptive Policymaking is a theoretical approach describing a planning process with different types of actions (e.g. 'mitigating actions' and 'hedging actions') and signposts to monitor to see if adaptation is needed. In contrast, Adaptation Pathways provides an analytical approach for exploring and sequencing a set of possible actions based on alternative external developments over time. We illustrate the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach by producing an adaptive plan for long-term water management of the Rhine Delta in the Netherlands that takes into account the deep uncertainties about the future arising from social, political, technological, economic, and climate changes. The results suggest that it is worthwhile to further test and use the approach. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The lack of integrated planning frameworks considering these SIDS-characteristics has stalled progress on sustainable waste management. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an integrated methodology for long-term waste management planning to deliver on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in SIDS. This explicitly combines multi-level participatory SDG visioning and back-casting with waste infrastructure modelling. This methodological development is piloted using a national-scale demonstration on Curacao. Three island-specific waste management portfolios (Inaction, Circular Economy, Technology-led), developed through stakeholder back-casting, are modelled for SDG delivery using a national accounting model under different socio-economic futures. The results highlight the importance of waste prevention and material re-use strategies within islands that engage local populations. Evidence-based identification and evaluation of waste management strategies, grounded in participatory processes, can itself contribute to SDG delivery.},
