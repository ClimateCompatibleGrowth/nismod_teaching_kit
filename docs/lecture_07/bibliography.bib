   abstract = {The aim of this work is to give a contribution in the field of stakeholder engagement in order to reduce the widespread conflicts arising when transport plans have to be implemented and understand the role of quantitative methods to support shared decisions. We present the results of a participation experiment, with university students as stakeholders, where the AHP method was applied to derive individual priority vectors, on the basis of their judgments of preference between all couples of alternatives regarding the mobility management of their university. The aggregation of the individual judgments was done by using different methods, some derived from AHP and other derived from voting methods, such as Pairwise Majority Rule (PMR). A discussion about the results of the different methods, before and after stakeholder interaction, and from an agent-based simulation in terms of respect of the consistency condition and degree of consensus of the collective decision will provide some recommendations that can be useful to guide effective and efficient participation process.},

   abstract = {<p>Conventionally how states ‘infrastructured’ was based around the monocentrism of the positive state. The progressive liberalisation of infrastructure over the past three decades has given rise to polycentric national infrastructure systems (NIS). This polycentric NIS exhibits a higher degree of structural, spatial and operational complexity with the state being one player though it still plays a prominent role not just through its own activities but also in seeking to steer the system to meet its territorial objectives. This is done through the formal interaction between hard and soft infrastructure (with the later characterised by themes of sustainability, consistency and criticality) components of the NIS. These themes are explored through an analysis of the UK’s National Infrastructure Plan where – it is argued – the formation of the UK NIS is characterised by a strategy of sustainable polycentrism though this strategy has yet to deliver the investment anticipated.</p>},

   abstract = {The water-energy-food nexus has achieved considerable prominence across academic research and policy sectors. The nexus sets an imperative for integrated management and policymaking, centring on the potential trade-offs and complementarities between interdependent water, energy and food systems. Applications of the nexus focus largely on technical or managerial solutions and calls to acknowledge the political dimension of nexus interdependencies have implications for governance at the urban scale. This paper aims to ‘urbanise' the nexus agenda and consider the implications of policy integration for urban governance. This examines the nexus in the context of current approaches to urban governance and power relations shaping the provision of water, energy and food in urban areas. Urban infrastructure networks underpin these resource systems and related management systems, although their management tends to operate in silos, with little joint decision-making and planning. Three hypotheses about the interplay between integrative policy framings and urban governance are explored to reconcile integrative policy framings at the urban scale: the appropriation of the nexus narrative by urban governments; re-establishment of political power through integrated management, and implementation of the nexus through smart city approaches. These hypotheses progress the political dimension of the nexus debate and reflect on the role of urban governance in addressing global challenges.},

   abstract = {Water and electricity are fundamentally linked. At a basic level electricity generation requires water, and water treatment and transportation use electricity. Historically, there has been little reason to understand the nature of these links, due largely to the presumption that water was not a threat to energy security, nor electricity a threat to water security. This presumption is now being challenged. Industry reforms, increasing demand, and more recently climate change – are bringing into sharp focus the links between water and electricity in unprecedented ways. General awareness of the links between water and electricity is increasing daily, as the ramifications of the links are being felt the world over: Society's ability to deal with the challenges and uncertainties arising from the links between water and electricity is being hindered by limited understanding of the nature of the links, and seeming lack of policy tools to effectively analyze them. This paper reviews comprehensively the links between water and electricity. Presents a classification system for identifying links. Using the classification system, this study further discusses these links by drawing upon examples from literature and follows with a synopsis of the nature of these links. With this background, the paper reviews and compares water-energy studies in terms of scope, objectives, methodologies and key findings, discusses major limitations of these studies and identifies important areas that would benefit from more in-depth research. This research contends that this type of approach is unsuitable in the longer term, particularly when examining complex and multidimensional issues like the water-energy nexus. This work suggests that the nature of the nexus should and can be explored from a wider perspective, by developing a suitable integrated methodological framework to serve as a platform for such exploration. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to outline the development of such a framework. Introduces Integral Theory and discusses how Integral Theory has shaped the development of the methodological framework employed in this research. Presents the framework and describes the suite of methods.},

   abstract = {Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are defined by IUCN as actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges (e.g. climate change, food and water security or natural disasters) effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. The NbS concept, as used in environmental sciences and nature conservation contexts, has emerged within the last decade or so, as international organisations search for ways to work with ecosystems – rather than relying on conventional engineering solutions (such as seawalls) – to adapt to and mitigate climate change effects, while improving sustainable livelihoods and protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity. NbS is a relatively ‘young’ concept, still in the process of being framed. There is a need now to deepen our understanding of NbS and confirm the principles upon which NbS is based, in order to move towards an operational framework that can guide applications of the NbS concept. The following set of NbS principles are proposed. Nature-based Solutions: 1. embrace nature conservation norms (and principles); 2. can be implemented alone or in an integrated manner with other solutions to societal challenges (e.g. technological and engineering solutions); 3. are determined by site-specific natural and cultural contexts that include traditional, local and scientific knowledge; 4. produce societal benefits in a fair and equitable way, in a manner that promotes transparency and broad participation; 5. maintain biological and cultural diversity and the ability of ecosystems to evolve over time; 6. are applied at the scale at a landscape; 7. recognise and address the trade-offs between the production of a few immediate economic benefits for development, and future options for the production of the full range of ecosystems services; 8. are an integral part of the overall design of policies, and measures or actions, to address a specific challenge. NbS is best considered an umbrella concept that covers a range of different approaches. These approaches have emerged from a variety of spheres (some from the scientific research domain, others from practice or policy contexts) but share a common focus on ecosystem services and aim to address societal challenges. These NbS approaches can be classified into: (i) ecosystem restoration approaches (e.g. ecological restoration, ecological engineering and forest landscape restoration); (ii) issuespecific ecosystem-related approaches (e.g. ecosystem-based adaptation, ecosystem-based mitigation, and ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction); (iii) infrastructure-related approaches (e.g. natural infrastructure and green infrastructure approaches); (iv) ecosystembased management approaches (e.g. integrated coastal zone management and integrated water resources management); and (v) ecosystem protection approaches (e.g. area-based conservation approaches including protected area management). A lack of operational clarity presents a major obstacle to the credibility and applicability of new concepts in the fields of conservation and development. Several parallel exercises are currently underway to develop operational parameters for specific NbS approaches (such as Ecosystem-based Adaptation and REDD+), each proposing its own set of criteria. Many of these criteria could be relevant for other approaches within the NbS ‘family’ and there is likely an overarching set of parameters, or ‘standards’, that can guide implementation of all types of NbS interventions. To help in this endeavour, five preliminary parameters are proposed: ecological complexity, long-term stability, scale of ecological organisation, direct societal benefits and adaptive governance. By unifying NbS approaches under a single operational framework, it becomes possible to scale up their implementation and strengthen their impact in mitigating the world’s most pressing challenges.},

Using a risk and decision analysis methodology that is transferable to other vulnerable coastal cities of high strategic economic and political importance, we quantify sequences of adaptations that would be needed to protect London from flooding by the sea to the year 2300. Two critical adaptation thresholds are identified: (i) when mechanical pumping has to be provided alongside the moveable tidal barrier in order to drain the River Thames and (ii) when a permanently closed barrier with pumping to remove all of the river flow becomes the only viable means of avoiding flooding. We test the sensitivity of the costs and benefits of alternative adaptation pathways to a wide range of sea level rise trajectories. The adaptation pathway that most cost-effectively and robustly maintains risk at a tolerable level involves moving the Thames Barrier 17 km towards the sea if mean sea level rises 2 m above present levels. Our methodology provides a quantitative risk-based implementation of an adaptation pathway.},

   abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement pose new conceptual challenges for energy decision makers by compelling them to consider the implications of their choices for development and climate mitigation objectives. This is a nontrivial exercise as it requires pragmatic consideration of the interconnections between energy systems and their social and environmental contexts and working with a plurality of actors and values. There are an increasing number of indices, frameworks and academic studies that capture these interconnections, yet policy makers have relatively few ex-ante tools to pragmatically aid decision-making. This paper, based on a collation of 167 studies, reviews how multi-criteria decision approaches (MCDA) are used in energy policy decisions to explicitly consider multiple social and environmental objectives, and the conceptual usefulness of doing so. First, MCDA can be used to distil a finite set of objectives from those of a large number of actors. This process is often political and objectives identified are aligned with vested interests or institutional incentives. Second, MCDA can be used to build evidence that is both qualitative and quantitative in nature to capture the implications of energy choices across economic, environmental, social and political metrics. Third, MCDA can be used to explore synergies and trade-offs between energy, social and environmental objectives, and in turn, make explicit the political implications of choices for actors. The studies reviewed in this paper demonstrate that the use of MCDA is so far mainly academic and for problems in the Global North. We argue for a mainstreaming of such a multi-criteria and deliberative approaches for energy policy decisions in developing countries where trade-offs between energy, development and climate mitigation are more contentious while recognizing the data, capacity and transparency requirements of the process.},

   abstract = {Traditionally, networks have been studied in an independent fashion. With the emergence of novel smart city technologies, coupling among networks has been strengthened. To capture the ever-increasing coupling, we explain the notion of interdependent networks, i.e., multi-layered networks with shared decision-making entities, and shared sensing infrastructures with interdisciplinary applications. The main challenge is how to develop data analytics solutions that are capable of enabling interdependent decision making. One of the emerging solutions is agent-based distributed decision making among heterogeneous agents and entities when their decisions are affected by multiple networks. We first provide a big picture of real-world interdependent networks in the context of smart city infrastructures. We then provide an outline of potential challenges and solutions from a data science perspective. We discuss potential hindrances to ensure reliable communication among intelligent agents from different networks. We explore future research directions at the intersection of network science and data science. This article provides a holistic overview of interdependent cyber-physical-societal networks. We envision the subsequent research directions that require contribution of the data science community as well as interdisciplinary collaboration with network scientists, social scientists, computer scientists, and engineers to tackle the emerging problems raised by the notion of interdependent networks: (1) developing novel algorithms for data analytics and enabling interdependent decision making, (2) proposing holistic models that are capable of capturing the interdependence among human-centered multi-layer critical infrastructures, and (3) developing efficient solutions that are capable of finding globally optimum solutions using information from each network as well as modeling the interdependent information exchange. In addition to these directions, we outline policy and access-control issues, including conflict of interest among stakeholders and operators of each network. Successful implementation and development of an interdependent data analytics framework and its required algorithms will improve the quality of life of citizens by enabling globally optimum decision making, increasing efficiency, preserving privacy of intelligent agents, and reducing operational cost of interdependent networks.

Real-world complex networks are coupled through shared entities and decision makers; e.g., there is a transition toward coupled smart cities infrastructures by integrating intelligent technologies. In this study, we provide a holistic overview of coupled societal-water-energy-economical-transportation (SWEET) networks as critical components of smart cities. We explore required methods to ensure optimal decision making and data analytics considering the increasing coupling of these human-centered networks.

This contribution proposes a structured approach for designing climate adaptation policies based on the concepts of Adaptation Pathways, Adaptive Policy Making, and Real Options Analysis. Such an approach results in incorporation of flexibility that allows change over time in response to how the future unfolds, what is learned about the system, and changes in societal preferences.

   abstract = {The conventional tools of decision-making in water resources infrastructure planning have been developed for problems with well-characterized uncertainties and are ill-suited for problems involving climate nonstationarity. In the past 20 years, a predict-then-act-based approach to the incorporation of climate nonstationarity has been widely adopted in which the outputs of bias-corrected climate model projections are used to evaluate planning options. However, the ambiguous nature of results has often proved unsatisfying to decision makers. This paper presents the use of a bottom-up, decision scaling framework for the evaluation of water resources infrastructure design alternatives regarding their robustness to climate change and expected value of performance. The analysis begins with an assessment of the vulnerability of the alternative designs under a wide domain of systematically-generated plausible future climates and utilizes downscaled climate projections ex post to inform likelihoods within a risk-based evaluation. The outcomes under different project designs are compared by way of a set of decision criteria, including the performance under the most likely future, expected value of performance across all evaluated futures and robustness. The method is demonstrated for the design of a hydropower system in sub-Saharan Africa and is compared to the results that would be found using a GCM-based, scenario-led analysis. The results indicate that recommendations from the decision scaling analysis can be substantially different from the scenario-led approach, alleviate common shortcomings related to the use of climate projections in water resources planning, and produce recommendations that are more robust to future climate uncertainty.},

   abstract = {Water supply infrastructure planning in groundwater-dependent regions is often challenged by uncertainty in future groundwater resource availability. Many major aquifer systems face long-term water table decline due to unsustainable withdrawals. However, many regions, especially those in the developing world, have a scarcity of groundwater data. This creates large uncertainties in groundwater resource predictions and decisions about whether to develop alternative supply sources. Developing infrastructure too soon can lead to unnecessary and expensive irreversible investments, but waiting too long can threaten water supply reliability. This study develops an adaptive infrastructure planning framework that applies Bayesian learning on groundwater observations to assess opportunities to learn about groundwater availability in the future and adapt infrastructure plans. This approach allows planners in data scarce regions to assess under what conditions a flexible infrastructure planning approach, in which initial plans are made but infrastructure development is deferred, can mitigate the risk of overbuilding infrastructure while maintaining water supply reliability in the face of uncertainty. This framework connects engineering options analysis from infrastructure planning to groundwater resources modeling. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept on a desalination planning case for the city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where poor characterization of a fossil aquifer creates uncertainty in how long current groundwater resources can reliably supply demand. We find that a flexible planning approach reduces the risk of over-building infrastructure compared to a traditional static planning approach by 40% with minimal reliability risk (<1%). This striking result may be explained by the slow-evolving nature of groundwater decline, which provides time for planners to react, in contrast to more sudden risks such as flooding where tradeoffs between cost and reliability risk are heightened. This Bayesian approach shows promise for many civil infrastructure domains by providing a method to quantify learning in environmental modeling and assess the effectiveness of adaptive planning.},

   abstract = {The use of scenarios in strategic (terrestrial) spatial planning has been widely accepted for a number of years (ESPON 2007; Haughton et al. 2010). A range of scenario-building techniques has also been applied within marine management in order to support decision-making (Van Hoof et al. 2014; Lukic et al. 2018). Scenario-building is now attracting some attention within the specific context of marine/maritime spatial planning (MSP) too. This chapter explores the extent to which scenario-building is starting to be introduced and presents a scenario-building exercise carried out in relation to a transboundary MSP exercise for the Celtic Seas region. This example of scenario-building takes previous practice as its starting point but aims to produce a narrative that focuses more directly on two of the most critical issues for MSP in transbound-ary spaces-namely evolving patterns of spatial development in the marine area and the need for increased cooperation between MSP authorities. Scenario-building is one of a set of terms being used to suggest a future-oriented, strategic dimension to planning; visions, forecasts, strategies, prospective road maps and action plans also suggest forward-looking tools to support plan-making. For simplicity, in this chapter, we focus on the notion of scenarios. The concept has its origins in military strategy and business plan},

   abstract = {There is a growing interest in model-based decision support under deep uncertainty, reflected in a variety of approaches being put forward in the literature. A key idea shared among these is the use of models for exploratory rather than predictive purposes. Exploratory modeling aims at exploring the implications for decision making of the various presently irresolvable uncertainties. This is achieved by conducting series of computational experiments that cover how the various uncertainties might resolve. This paper presents an open source library supporting this. The Exploratory Modeling Workbench is implemented in Python. It is designed to (i) support the generation and execution of series of computational experiments; and (ii) support the visualization and analysis of the results from the computational experiments. The Exploratory Modeling Workbench enables users to easily perform exploratory modeling with existing models, identify the policy-relevant uncertainties, assess the efficacy of policy options, and iteratively improve candidate strategies.},

   abstract = {A new paradigm for planning under conditions of deep uncertainty has emerged in the literature. According to this paradigm, a planner should create a strategic vision of the future, commit to short-term actions, and establish a framework to guide future actions. A plan that embodies these ideas allows for its dynamic adaptation over time to meet changing circumstances. We propose a method for decisionmaking under uncertain global and regional changes called 'Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways'. We base our approach on two complementary approaches for designing adaptive plans: 'Adaptive Policymaking' and 'Adaptation Pathways'. Adaptive Policymaking is a theoretical approach describing a planning process with different types of actions (e.g. 'mitigating actions' and 'hedging actions') and signposts to monitor to see if adaptation is needed. In contrast, Adaptation Pathways provides an analytical approach for exploring and sequencing a set of possible actions based on alternative external developments over time. We illustrate the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach by producing an adaptive plan for long-term water management of the Rhine Delta in the Netherlands that takes into account the deep uncertainties about the future arising from social, political, technological, economic, and climate changes. The results suggest that it is worthwhile to further test and use the approach. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {A variety of model-based approaches for supporting decision-making under deep uncertainty have been suggested, but they are rarely compared and contrasted. In this paper, we compare Robust Decision-Making with Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways. We apply both to a hypothetical case inspired by a river reach in the Rhine Delta of the Netherlands, and compare them with respect to the required tooling, the resulting decision relevant insights, and the resulting plans. The results indicate that the two approaches are complementary. Robust Decision-Making offers insights into conditions under which problems occur, and makes trade-offs transparent. The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach emphasizes dynamic adaptation over time, and thus offers a natural way for handling the vulnerabilities identified through Robust Decision-Making. The application also makes clear that the analytical process of Robust Decision-Making is path-dependent and open ended: an analyst has to make many choices, for which Robust Decision-Making offers no direct guidance.},

   abstract = {Protecting the UK's capital city from global mean sea level rise that the IPCC considers plausible over the next centuries would require a combination of a new tidal barrier, high volume pumping and incremental raising of the system of flood walls and embankments. Using a risk and decision analysis methodology that is transferable to other vulnerable coastal cities of high strategic economic and political importance, we quantify sequences of adaptations that would be needed to protect London from flooding by the sea to the year 2300. Two critical adaptation thresholds are identified: (i) when mechanical pumping has to be provided alongside the moveable tidal barrier in order to drain the River Thames and (ii) when a permanently closed barrier with pumping to remove all of the river flow becomes the only viable means of avoiding flooding. We test the sensitivity of the costs and benefits of alternative adaptation pathways to a wide range of sea level rise trajectories. The adaptation pathway that most cost-effectively and robustly maintains risk at a tolerable level involves moving the Thames Barrier 17 km towards the sea if mean sea level rises 2 m above present levels. Our methodology provides a quantitative risk-based implementation of an adaptation pathway.},

   abstract = {Water supply infrastructure planning in groundwater-dependent regions is often challenged by uncertainty in future groundwater resource availability. Many major aquifer systems face long-term water table decline due to unsustainable withdrawals. However, many regions, especially those in the developing world, have a scarcity of groundwater data. This creates large uncertainties in groundwater resource predictions and decisions about whether to develop alternative supply sources. Developing infrastructure too soon can lead to unnecessary and expensive irreversible investments, but waiting too long can threaten water supply reliability. This study develops an adaptive infrastructure planning framework that applies Bayesian learning on groundwater observations to assess opportunities to learn about groundwater availability in the future and adapt infrastructure plans. This approach allows planners in data scarce regions to assess under what conditions a flexible infrastructure planning approach, in which initial plans are made but infrastructure development is deferred, can mitigate the risk of overbuilding infrastructure while maintaining water supply reliability in the face of uncertainty. This framework connects engineering options analysis from infrastructure planning to groundwater resources modeling. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept on a desalination planning case for the city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where poor characterization of a fossil aquifer creates uncertainty in how long current groundwater resources can reliably supply demand. We find that a flexible planning approach reduces the risk of over-building infrastructure compared to a traditional static planning approach by 40% with minimal reliability risk (<1%). This striking result may be explained by the slow-evolving nature of groundwater decline, which provides time for planners to react, in contrast to more sudden risks such as flooding where tradeoffs between cost and reliability risk are heightened. This Bayesian approach shows promise for many civil infrastructure domains by providing a method to quantify learning in environmental modeling and assess the effectiveness of adaptive planning.},

The lack of integrated planning frameworks considering these SIDS-characteristics has stalled progress on sustainable waste management. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an integrated methodology for long-term waste management planning to deliver on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in SIDS. This explicitly combines multi-level participatory SDG visioning and back-casting with waste infrastructure modelling. This methodological development is piloted using a national-scale demonstration on Curacao. Three island-specific waste management portfolios (Inaction, Circular Economy, Technology-led), developed through stakeholder back-casting, are modelled for SDG delivery using a national accounting model under different socio-economic futures. The results highlight the importance of waste prevention and material re-use strategies within islands that engage local populations. Evidence-based identification and evaluation of waste management strategies, grounded in participatory processes, can itself contribute to SDG delivery.},
