## Short description

This lecture provides an overview of methods that can be used to
estimate the value of nature-based solutions' services. This lecture
also presents a cost comparison of nature-based solutions to their
corresponding traditional grey infrastructures. Case studies of valuing
nature-based solutions in practice are also presented.

## Learning objectives 

-   Recognise that nature-based solutions are cost-effective in
    resolving many issues

-   Gain a general understanding of the common methods in estimating the
    monetary values of nature-based solutions

-   Perform cost-benefit analysis for nature-based solutions.

# Lecture content 

## Nature-based solutions are cost-effective 

Nature-based solutions are effective for many problems faced by society,
including water regulation (Lecture 16.1), soil stabilisation (Lecture
16.3), coastal protection (Lecture 16.2), potable water supply (Lecture
17.1), wastewater treatment (Lecture 17.2), and cooling (Lecture 16.4).
They have economic advantages compared to traditional grey
infrastructure due to (1) lower construction and maintenance costs and
(2) additional economic returns from co-benefits.

Better understanding of the cost and benefit of nature-based solutions
will inform better policy making through economic incentives
[@MEA2005]:

-   Elimination of subsidies that promote excessive use of ecosystem
    services (and, where possible, transfer of these subsidies to
    payments for non-marketed ecosystem services)

-   Greater use of economic instruments and market-based approaches in
    the management of ecosystem services

    -   Taxes or user fees for activities with "external" costs

    -   Creation of markets, including through cap-and-trade systems

    -   Payment for ecosystem services

    -   Mechanisms to enable consumer preferences to be expressed
        through markets.

## Methods for valuing the benefits of nature-based solutions 

Nature based solutions provide many valuable provisioning, regulating,
supporting, and cultural services:

-   **Provisioning services:** Embodied in the products that are
    directly consumed, such as the fish produced by a fishery or a crop
    from agricultural land. These services are most often traded in
    markets

-   **Supporting services:** Underlying ecosystem processes, such as
    soil formation and oxygen production, which support the functioning
    of other ecosystem services

-   **Regulating services:** Ecosystem functions that control
    biophysical cycles and levels, such as nutrient cycling, water
    filtration, or flood frequency and height

-   **Cultural services:** The intangible benefits ecosystems provide to
    people through emotional enjoyment, such as aesthetic experiences
    and recreation.

When estimating the value of these services, a distinction is usually
made between "use or nonuse", "direct or indirect", and "market and
nonmarket" services [@WorldBank2016]. The value of provisioning
services can usually be estimated by their market price, i.e. the
monetary value of the food and materials. The value of the regulating
services, such as flood regulation and storm protection, can be
estimated through the avoided cost method, the replacement cost method,
and the expected damage function approach. The value of the supporting
and culture service can be estimated by the property value method and
the contingent valuation method.

## Cost comparison of nature-based solutions and grey infrastructure

A growing body of evidence suggests that nature-based solutions are
lower in cost compared to traditional grey infrastructure when
addressing climate hazards. For example, @Ferrario2014 reported that
while the wave height reduction capability of reefs is comparable to
that of tropical breakwaters (51--74% and 30--70%, respectively), the
construction cost of structural coral reef is less than 10 % of that of
breakwaters (median project cost of USD1,290/m and USD19,791/m,
respectively). Through a meta-study of fifty-two nature-based defence
projects, @Narayan2016 found that the replacement cost of nature-based
defences (with hard engineering construction) is 2 to 5 times higher
than the cost of restoring the natural systems. In addition,
nature-based solutions show an increase in cost effectiveness at
locations with higher water-depths, owing to the relatively steep
increase in breakwater construction cost in deeper water.

Nevertheless, the protective value of hard infrastructure is usually
received with higher confidence, hence, careful cost-benefit analysis is
needed in any given situation to justify the choice of nature-based
solutions. Hybrid approaches, where nature-based solutions and grey
infrastructure may be used in tandem, will have advantages in many ways.
Nature-based solutions can help to buffer against unpredictable impacts
of climate change which grey infrastructure alone may not be able to
withstand. Nature-based solutions can increase the benefit-to-cost
ratios of a project by reducing the cost of engineered approaches, and
by generating additional favourable benefits from the co-benefits, which
may increase over time as the nature-based components mature.

## Case study: Cost-benefit analysis of mangrove plantation in Viet Nam

Viet Nam, with an extensive coastline of over 3,000 km, is highly
vulnerable to many climate-related disasters such as storms and
sea-level rise, which can be aggravated by the rapid population growth,
coastal modifications, and extensive land-use changes. To increase the
resilience of the disaster-prone coastal provinces of northern Viet Nam,
the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
(IFRC) implemented a community-based 'Mangrove Plantation and Disaster
Risk Reduction' (MP/DRR) project [@RedCross2012]. The MP/DRR project
aims to implement reforestation and afforestation of mangrove,
casuarina, and bamboo forests on coastal and riverine areas, to reduce
the impact from hazards including storm surges, flooding, sea level
rise, and drought.

The project spanned 17 years from 1994 to 2010 and cost USD8.88 million.
It created 9,462ha of forest, of which 8,961ha were mangroves. Trees are
planted in 166 communes. The number of direct beneficiaries was 350,000.
Table 18.3.3 shows the estimated economic benefits resulting from the
project. The benefit-cost ratio of the project is almost 30.

\*for selected communes only

In fact, the value of many other co-benefits, such as nutrient
retention, sediment retention, biodiversity habitat, flood attenuation,
wastewater treatment, water supply and recharge, are not included. With
improved information of the co-benefits, the benefit-cost ratio would be
even higher.

## Case study: Estimating the total economic value of Bermuda's coral reefs

@Sarkis2013 estimated the total economic value of Bermuda's reef by
identifying and valuing six key goods and services provided by the
ecosystem. Bermuda supports one of the "healthiest" coral reef systems
of the Wider Caribbean Region, with a coral cover ranging from 22% to
70% (Figure 18.3.1). Bermuda's reef system is of global importance as
the northernmost reef system in the Atlantic Ocean. Nonetheless,
Bermuda's reefs are ranked worldwide at "high risk", in great part due
to the island's high human population density within 20km of the reefs.

### Figure 18.3.1: Bermuda's known coral reef cover including hard and soft coral species [@Sarkis2013]

The six key ecosystem goods and services identified are:

1.  Coral reef-associated tourism

2.  Reef-associated fisheries

3.  Amenity or reef associated surplus value on real estate

4.  Physical coastal protection

5.  Reef-associated recreational and cultural values

6.  Research and educational value.

Table 18.3.4 summarises the value of the six key services and the method
used to estimate those values. The total economic value of the coral
reefs is estimated to be USD722.4 million/year, with tourism and coastal
protection adding the majority of the value, composing of 56% and 37% of
the total economic value, respectively.

The high economic value of the coral reefs will generate awareness of
the importance of the ecosystem. This study demonstrates a comprehensive
way to estimate the economic value of ecosystems, providing a critical
tool for different stakeholders to integrate the ecosystem health and
functions into public policy and decision-making. Based on results from
the study, recommendations are provided for future policy making:

-   Prioritise potential policy interventions in an economically sound
    manner

-   Make use of the cultural importance residents play on marine
    ecosystems to improve coral reef management

-   Actively involve the tourism industry in the development of
    sustainable coral reef management

-   Balance consumptive and non-consumptive uses of coral reefs by
    strategising spatial management and protecting critical marine
    areas.

## Summary

Nature-based solutions are effective and economically sensible. They
offer higher benefit/cost ratio compared to traditional grey
infrastructure by reducing construction cost and providing extra
valuable co-benefits. This lecture introduces various methods for
valuing services of nature-based solutions. Case studies of valuing the
mangrove plantation in Viet Nam and the coral reefs in Bermuda
demonstrates the application of these methods in practice.
