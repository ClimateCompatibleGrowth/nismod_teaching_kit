This mini-lecture reflects on limitations of different methods to
develop infrastructure strategies, which includes participatory methods
or content analysis methods. It provides examples of how transparently
highlighting potential data gaps, as well as specifying the confidence
of the data analysed, can help to reduce limitations inherent in the
various methods.

# Learning objectives

-   Describe drawbacks of different methods of developing infrastructure
    strategies
-   Provide suggestions of how different drawbacks could be addressed.

# The importance of reflecting on methods for infrastructure strategy development

All methods to generate infrastructure strategies will inevitably have
drawbacks.

In this mini-lecture, we will reflect broadly on the concepts of
infrastructure strategies and drawbacks that are applicable to any
method.

We will then reflect in more detail on methods used to generate
infrastructure strategies for the participatory methods, and content
analysis.

Finally, this mini-lecture will reflect critically on the concept of
infrastructure strategy development, and highlight recommendations for
generating infrastructure strategies in practice.

Any participatory method, including forecasting or backcasting (for more
information on the different participatory methods, see mini-lecture
6.2) faces significant limitations with respect to stakeholder
selection, participation rate, time and resource constraints
[@Cairns2013; @Ballard2005]. Content analysis can provide a more
time and resource effective means to develop infrastructure strategies,
yet this method relies heavily on published reports and literature,
often neglecting valuable investments or interventions that are not
recorded in written reports or literature.

# Reflecting on potential drawbacks of participatory forecasting and backcasting methods

Participatory methods have the potential to combine opinions from various experts in order to forecast and explore different infrastructure investments or policies, thereby creating ownership over investments. However, it is often difficult to identify experts or stakeholders to attend participatory workshops or focus groups.
Participatory methods are time- and resource-intensive, as they involve:

-   Identifying expert stakeholders across infrastructure sectors, ministries and users
-   Bringing these experts together in focus groups or participatory workshops
-   Post-processing by analysing the outcomes of expert group or workshop meetings.

Choosing which experts to involve in the process of foresight or forecasting workshops is a highly contested topic. The process of identifying and inviting experts is prone to participant sample. Further, which experts attend (and do not attend) foresight workshops can influence results. Overrepresentation of stakeholders from a specific sector or with a certain view of the future may skew results in a specific direction. Invited experts may represent a certain group only (e.g. socio-economic, gender, race etc.), potentially resulting in less equitable or highly contested proposed policies or interventions.

Even if experts from a range of different socio-economic backgrounds are
selected, issues of power will influence the chosen interventions. Who
makes decisions or speaks up in workshops or focus groups is often a
function of the exercise of power [@Midgley2000; @Ulrich1987], and
can therefore affect the results.

While the idea of participatory sessions where multiple experts agree on different futures is a valuable concept, it is important to be aware of its potential drawbacks.

# Overcoming potential drawbacks of participatory methods

Participatory methods can be designed to reduce time and resources, for
example by starting with the generation of strategies based on published
reports or studies, and specific in-country 'champions' in the
infrastructure sector. Participatory fore- or back-casting methods can
then be used as a supplement, to update and improve information that has
previously been suggested.

To persuade stakeholders to attend workshops, it can be useful to
identify specific in-country individuals with an intrinsic motivation to
ensure sustainable infrastructure development. These individuals can
then be asked to use their network and ensure a snowballing effect.

To account for limitations with respect to the sample of participants as
well as power relations, multi-background backcasting studies explicitly
invite a broader range of stakeholders across different multiple
backgrounds to account for the limitation of an overrepresentation of
specific groups. By inviting stakeholders with a variety of backgrounds,
for example including indigenous peoples, strategies generated can
strengthen networks across groups and foster social learning
[@Nikolakis2020]. Participant attendance can subsequently be
increased by using snowballing methods, where one participant suggests
or invites further participants, thereby increasing the total number of
stakeholders.

Additionally, participatory workshops or focus groups can be
complemented with one-on-one interviews with particular stakeholders,
whose voices might not have been heard in previous workshops.
Multi-stakeholder mapping, a method to identify all potential
stakeholders in a specific infrastructure sector, can be used as a
checklist to ensure that all potentially relevant stakeholders have been
included in the process of strategy generation. For more information on
multi-stakeholder mapping, we refer readers to existing literature
[@Mayers2005; @Sova2014; @Fuldauer2018].

# Reflecting on and overcoming drawbacks of content analysis

Content analysis is another method to identify infrastructure
interventions and develop infrastructure strategies. However, the
process of review of national policy documents, feasibility studies, or
reports in a specific infrastructure sector is influenced by
disciplinary background, positionality as well as availability of
literature evidence. Author teams determine what research is included or
excluded and how to deal with conflicting arguments [@Fairclough2010;
@Victor2015]. The following mini-lecture (6.4) highlights this
procedure through the use of a case study.

To reduce the potential limitations of content analysis, it is important
to review policy documents and reports across various sectors within the
country or sector in question and beyond. If possible, working with
in-country stakeholders across infrastructure sectors, ministries,
academia and the public can help to identify further published
information to underpin the content analysis and ensure that no
important information is omitted from the analysis, as has been shown in
practical examples of infrastructure strategy development
[@Adshead2021; @Fuldauer2019].

Content analysis is based on which policy documents and reports are
available, which may underrepresent certain factors critical for the
development of infrastructure strategies. To account for this
limitation, grey literature (such as international reports), can be
included in the research. Transparently highlighting potential gaps as
well as the confidence in the literature analysed can help to reduce
thee limitations of the content analysis approach (see Hands-on 3, for
example).

# Conclusions and suggestions

Developing infrastructure strategies is an inherently difficult process, which is influenced by the stakeholders engaged, the positionality of the author, and the availability of the literature evidence, amongst other factors.
There is no single best method to generate infrastructure strategies to meet certain visions of the future. Whilst participatory methods are more likely to generate strategies that are considered feasible and implementable by stakeholders, they are prone to stakeholder sample sizes and power issues, and are time- and resource-intensive. Using snowballing methods can help increase stakeholder sample size, and inviting stakeholders from multiple backgrounds can help to ameliorate selection biases on certain infrastructure investments/strategies.
Content analysis provides a useful means to identify confirmed, proposed or potential infrastructure interventions, yet this method is highly dependent on the literature content available in each country. Especially in data-scarce environments, it might not be possible to identify infrastructure investments or strategies that can meet certain development outcomes. Reviewing international reports or using best-practice examples from similar or neighbouring countries can provide one means to overcome lack of data.
Hybrid methods that combine participatory and content analysis methods help to overcome some of the respective method limitations. Transparently highlighting gaps and uncertainties throughout the process of infrastructure strategy generation highlights their potential limitations, thereby identifying where future work is needed.
