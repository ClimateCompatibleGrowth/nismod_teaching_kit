abstract = {Failure of critical national infrastructures can cause disruptions with widespread economic impacts. To analyze these economic impacts, we present an integrated modeling framework that combines: (1) geospatial information on infrastructure assets/networks and the natural hazards to which they are exposed; (2) geospatial modeling of the reliance of businesses upon infrastructure services, in order to quantify disruption to businesses locations and economic activities in the event of infrastructure failures; and (3) multiregional supply-use economic modeling to analyze wider economic impacts of disruptions to businesses. The methodology is exemplified through a case study for the United Kingdom. The study uses geospatial information on the location of electricity infrastructure assets and local industrial areas, and employs a multiregional supply-use model of the UK economy that traces the impacts of floods of different return intervals across 37 subnational regions of the UK. The results show up to a 300{\%} increase in total economic losses when power outages are included in the risk assessment, compared to analysis that just includes the economic impacts of business interruption due to flooded business premises. This increase indicates that risk studies that do not include failure of critical infrastructures may be underestimating the total losses.},

abstract = {To date, national- and regional-scale flood risk assessments have provided valuable information about the annual expected consequences of flooding, but not the exposure to widespread concurrent flooding that could have damaging consequences for people and the economy. We present a new method for flood risk assessment that accommodates the risk of widespread flooding. It is based on a statistical conditional exceedance model, which is fitted to gauged data and describes the joint probability of extreme river flows or sea levels at multiple locations. The method can be applied together with data from models for flood defence systems and economic damages to calculate a risk profile describing the probability distribution of economic losses or other consequences aggregated over a region. The method has the potential to augment national or regional risk assessments of expected annual damage with new information about the likelihoods, extent and impacts of events that could contribute to the risk. {\textcopyright} The Authors.

abstract = {Transport infrastructure is exposed to natural hazards all around the world. Here we present the first global estimates of multi-hazard exposure and risk to road and rail infrastructure. Results reveal that {\~{}}27{\%} of all global road and railway assets are exposed to at least one hazard and {\~{}}7.5{\%} of all assets are exposed to a 1/100 year flood event. Global Expected Annual Damages (EAD) due to direct damage to road and railway assets range from 3.1 to 22 billion US dollars, of which {\~{}}73{\%} is caused by surface and river flooding. Global EAD are small relative to global GDP ({\~{}}0.02{\%}). However, in some countries EAD reach 0.5 to 1{\%} of GDP annually, which is the same order of magnitude as national transport infrastructure budgets. A cost-benefit analysis suggests that increasing flood protection would have positive returns on {\~{}}60{\%} of roads exposed to a 1/100 year flood event.},

abstract = {Ports form the backbone of the global economy. By combining a vast database of ship tracking data with bilateral trade data and input-output tables, we highlight the critical role of specific ports in global supply chains and economies. For some countries, we find that 43.5% of economic activity is dependent on trade going through a single port. The top ten global ports influence 9.3% of the global economy, of which the port of Shanghai alone embeds 1.7% of global output. Ports are even more critical in some sectors, such as the mining and quarrying sector, for which 82% of trade is transported by maritime transport. We estimate how changes in final demand will be routed through ports, revealing that for every US$1000 increase in final demand a country’s ports experience a US$18.3 increase in imports on average, and up to US$108 increase in low income countries and small islands.},

abstract = {The risks of cooling water shortages to thermo-electric power plants are increasingly studied as an important climate risk to the energy sector. Whilst electricity transmission networks reduce the risks during disruptions, more costly plants must provide alternative supplies. Here, we investigate the electricity price impacts of cooling water shortages on Britain's power supplies using a probabilistic spatial risk model of regional climate, hydrological droughts and cooling water shortages, coupled with an economic model of electricity supply, demand and prices. We find that on extreme days (p99), almost 50{\%} (7GWe) of freshwater thermal capacity is unavailable. Annualized cumulative costs on electricity prices range from {\pounds}29–66m.yr-1 GBP2018, whilst in 20{\%} of cases from {\pounds}66-95m.yr-1. With climate change, the median annualized impact exceeds {\pounds}100m.yr-1. The single year impacts of a 1-in-25 year event exceed {\textgreater}{\pounds}200m, indicating the additional investments justifiable to mitigate the 1st-order economic risks of cooling water shortage during droughts.},
