	abstract = {Urban green space provides multiple ecological benefits, among which the reduction of rainfall runoff is important for sustainable urban development, particularly for cities experiencing severe flooding and water hazards. However, the effectiveness of urban green space in mitigating runoff has not been fully determined. We evaluated potential reductions in surface runoff associated with urban green space in central Beijing under a greening scenario using the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number method. The results show that urban green space offers significant potential for runoff mitigation. In 2012, a total of 97.9 million m3 of excess surface runoff was retained by urban green space; adding nearly 11{\%} more tree canopy was projected to increase runoff retention by {\textgreater}30{\%}, contributing to considerable benefits of urban rainwater regulation. At a more detailed scale, there were apparent internal variations. Urban function zones with {\textgreater}70{\%} developed land showed less mitigation of runoff, while green zones (vegetation {\textgreater}60{\%}), which occupied only 15.54{\%} of the total area, contributed 31.07{\%} of runoff reduction. Runoff reduction by urban green space, however, is influenced by many factors, such as rainfall, soil condition, and urban morphology. In regulating urban runoff, therefore, the priorities and integrating adaptive approaches to urban greening should be combined with compensatory and complementary measures.},

@book{Cohen-Shacham2016,
	abstract = {Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are defined by IUCN as actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges (e.g. climate change, food and water security or natural disasters) effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. The NbS concept, as used in environmental sciences and nature conservation contexts, has emerged within the last decade or so, as international organisations search for ways to work with ecosystems -- rather than relying on conventional engineering solutions (such as seawalls) -- to adapt to and mitigate climate change effects, while improving sustainable livelihoods and protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity. NbS is a relatively `young' concept, still in the process of being framed. There is a need now to deepen our understanding of NbS and confirm the principles upon which NbS is based, in order to move towards an operational framework that can guide applications of the NbS concept. The following set of NbS principles are proposed. Nature-based Solutions: 1. embrace nature conservation norms (and principles); 2. can be implemented alone or in an integrated manner with other solutions to societal challenges (e.g. technological and engineering solutions); 3. are determined by site-specific natural and cultural contexts that include traditional, local and scientific knowledge; 4. produce societal benefits in a fair and equitable way, in a manner that promotes transparency and broad participation; 5. maintain biological and cultural diversity and the ability of ecosystems to evolve over time; 6. are applied at the scale at a landscape; 7. recognise and address the trade-offs between the production of a few immediate economic benefits for development, and future options for the production of the full range of ecosystems services; 8. are an integral part of the overall design of policies, and measures or actions, to address a specific challenge. NbS is best considered an umbrella concept that covers a range of different approaches. These approaches have emerged from a variety of spheres (some from the scientific research domain, others from practice or policy contexts) but share a common focus on ecosystem services and aim to address societal challenges. These NbS approaches can be classified into: (i) ecosystem restoration approaches (e.g. ecological restoration, ecological engineering and forest landscape restoration); (ii) issuespecific ecosystem-related approaches (e.g. ecosystem-based adaptation, ecosystem-based mitigation, and ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction); (iii) infrastructure-related approaches (e.g. natural infrastructure and green infrastructure approaches); (iv) ecosystembased management approaches (e.g. integrated coastal zone management and integrated water resources management); and (v) ecosystem protection approaches (e.g. area-based conservation approaches including protected area management). A lack of operational clarity presents a major obstacle to the credibility and applicability of new concepts in the fields of conservation and development. Several parallel exercises are currently underway to develop operational parameters for specific NbS approaches (such as Ecosystem-based Adaptation and REDD+), each proposing its own set of criteria. Many of these criteria could be relevant for other approaches within the NbS `family' and there is likely an overarching set of parameters, or `standards', that can guide implementation of all types of NbS interventions. To help in this endeavour, five preliminary parameters are proposed: ecological complexity, long-term stability, scale of ecological organisation, direct societal benefits and adaptive governance. By unifying NbS approaches under a single operational framework, it becomes possible to scale up their implementation and strengthen their impact in mitigating the world's most pressing challenges.},

	abstract = {Wetlands are being considered increasingly important for wastewater treatment because of the ability of many wetland plants to absorb large amounts of nutrient and a variety of toxic substances. The paper highlights the physical, chemical and biological processes which contribute to the improvement of water quality, and the distinction between natural and constructed wetlands. The impacts of long-term wastewater disposal on the biotic changes, reduction in treatment efficiency, and wetland processes such as production of trace gases, are pointed out. Constraints in using wetlands, for wastewater treatment, such as poor understanding of the natural wetland functions and responses of native plants and animals to wastewater, particularly in developing countries, are briefly discussed. It is suggested that while the possibilities for using constructed wetlands based on native species for small communities are explored, greater emphasis should be laid on the restoration of lost and degraded wetlands, especially the river foodplains, lake littorals and coastal wetlands, which can help check pollution from non-point sources.},

	abstract = {Water hyacinth invasion has been highlighted to be a source of problem to riparian communities. They are known to reduce the velocity of water bodies, thereby serving as suitable breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Their obstruction to water transportation also means students who cross invaded water bodies to school will have their education negatively affected. Based on cross-sectional research with 305 respondents who were sampled using snowballing sampling procedure, this study assesses the effects of water hyacinth invasion on the health of the communities, and the education of children along River Tano and Abby-Tano Lagoon in Ghana. We found that water hyacinth invasion in the two water bodies was associated with malaria infestation. The blockade created also meant students delayed in their quest to access their schools. However, respondents mainly used insecticide-treated nets to cope with the spread of the mosquitoes that bred in the water hyacinth while parents made provision for their wards to stay outside the affected village across the River Tano in order to attend classes in the peak season of the invasion. We recommend that further studies should target only those people whose children cross River Tano to attend school in the Adusuazo community and increase their sample size. This will help gather detailed information on the effects of the invasion on the education of children. We also recommend that further studies should be conducted to provide more concrete data on the categories of respondents whose health are more affected by the invasion and their adaptive strategies.},

@article{Mul2015,
	abstract = {The Volta Basin is a transboundary basin shared by six riparian countries. In 2007, the Volta Basin Authority (VBA) was established and it was mandated to provide legal and institutional arrangements among the riparian countries for managing the water resources of the Volta Basin. The transboundary diagnostic analysis commissioned by the VBA has highlighted five key challenges that the basin faces: changes in water quantity and seasonal flows; degradation of ecosystems; water quality concerns; governance; and climate change. A key mandate of the VBA is authorizing the development of infrastructure and projects that could have a substantial impact on the water resources in the basin. The water resources in the Volta Basin contribute significantly to the economic development of the six riparian countries. This is the case particularly for Burkina Faso and Ghana where more than 60{\%} of the area of each country is located within the Volta Basin. The water resources are being utilized for agricultural production, domestic water use, livestock watering and hydropower production. Increasing demands on the resources have created competition between sectors and countries. Widespread construction of hydraulic infrastructure of different sizes and for different purposes has been developed over the years. Climate change and variability, and upstream water resources development have impacted the hydropower generation of Akosombo and Kpong dams, located close to the Volta Estuary. This comprises about 70{\%} of the installed hydropower capacity of the basin. The Volta Basin is also endowed with freshwater ecosystems which provide various ecosystem services that contribute to local livelihoods, and larger-scale basin objectives, by providing food, fuel and construction materials, regulating flows (reducing peak and increasing baseflows) as well as by providing habitats for animals, such as migrant birds, which may attract recreational activities. Both natural and built infrastructure provide benefits. Some benefits such as hydropower are only provided by built infrastructure but others, such as water treatment and flood control, can be provided by both natural and built infrastructure. In addition, natural infrastructure supports the performance of built infrastructure, through providing water of a certain quantify and quality. Degradation of natural infrastructure is a key concern in the Volta Basin and may affect the performance of downstream dams. On the other hand, natural infrastructure may be affected by the development and management of built infrastructure, as is observed downstream of the Akosombo Dam. Future water resources development in the Volta Basin requires an integrated approach towards built infrastructure development and investments in natural infrastructure to ensure optimal basin-wide benefits.},

	abstract = {Eucalyptus plantations were established rapidly over large areas of the world raising concerns over water resources and potentially negative ecohydrological effects. In this paper the impacts of Eucalyptus plantations on ecohydrology were summarized. In general, transpiration rates ranged from 0.5 to 6.0 mm per day and were affected by leaf area index (LAI), soil water, stand age, and species conversion. Catchment water yield increased after deforestation due to clearcutting, thinning, or fire, and declined after afforestation or reforestation. Water yield of catchments declined for the first 20-30 years after planting or regeneration of Eucalyptus as trees matured and closed canopies; water yield returned slowly to normal levels as stem density and LAI of Eucalyptus forests declined. Eucalyptus plantations may extract water from shallow groundwater sources in arid and semiarid areas, and in some tropical wet areas during drought years or seasons.},

	abstract = {Recent deforestation rates in Cambodia are among the world's largest, while hydropower development has accelerated in the Mekong region. Deforestation accelerates erosion, increasing river sediments heading to reservoirs and decreasing hydropower production. Forest protection could be seen as a service to hydropower, which the FOR-POWER model quantifies. Using recent deforestation estimates, annual sediment accumulation is calculated, followed by associated power generation loss, and annualized and present monetary value associated with benefits of forest conservation to hydropower. We evaluated four proposed medium-size hydropower dams (20--24 MW; 6--145 m3/s design discharge), and found that extensive deforestation could result in annual sediment accumulation of 360--930 million tons (reservoir dependent), but only 140--750 million tons in a forest conservation scenario. Overall, these reservoirs could lose 60--100{\%} of storage capacity over 120 years at current deforestation rates, resulting in power loss net present values for Pursat-I, Battambang I and II dams of US {\$}2.58, {\$}44.8 and {\$}28.8 million, respectively. A global sensitivity analysis showed that FOR-POWER was particularly sensitive to discount rates and electricity prices. The modeling tool developed for this study is transferable to other dams globally where hydropower development is accelerating and in need for better quantifying ecosystem services from surrounding watersheds.},

	abstract = {Tropical rainforest regions have large hydropower generation potential that figures prominently in many nations' energy growth strategies. Feasibility studies of hydropower plants typically ignore the effect of future deforestation or assume that deforestation will have a positive effect on river discharge and energy generation resulting from declines in evapotranspiration (ET) associated with forest conversion. Forest loss can also reduce river discharge, however, by inhibiting rainfall. We used land use, hydrological, and climate models to examine the local "direct" effects (through changes in ET within the watershed) and the potential regional "indirect" effects (through changes in rainfall) of deforestation on river discharge and energy generation potential for the Belo Monte energy complex, one of the world's largest hydropower plants that is currently under construction on the Xingu River in the eastern Amazon. In the absence of indirect effects of deforestation, simulated deforestation of 20{\%} and 40{\%} within the Xingu River basin increased discharge by 4-8{\%} and 10-12{\%}, with similar increases in energy generation.When indirect effects were considered, deforestation of the Amazon region inhibited rainfall within the Xingu Basin, counterbalancing declines in ET and decreasing discharge by 6-36{\%}. Under business-as-usual projections of forest loss for 2050 (40{\%}), simulated power generation declined to only 25{\%} of maximum plant output and 60{\%} of the industry's own projections. Like other energy sources, hydropower plants present large social and environmental costs. Their reliability as energy sources, however, must take into account their dependence on forests.},

	abstract = {Underwater environments in ports are designed for harbour activities solely. However, by simple and cost-effective measures, suitable habitat for underwater flora and fauna can be created. This is expected to have positive effects on higher trophic levels, such as fish, and improve water quality, by enlarging filter feeder biomass. In this study we developed 'pole hulas' and 'pontoon hulas', consisting of hanging ropes of different materials. The pole hulas are made up of many 6. mm thick and 55. cm long strings just above and below the mean low water level (MLWL) around poles. The pontoon hulas resemble raft like structures with 12. mm thick and 150. cm long ropes within the open space of mooring pontoons. The first experimentation with these structures was executed in the polyhaline harbours of the port of Rotterdam. The pole hulas were rapidly colonised by a variety of organisms. Above MLWL a seaweed community dominated on the strings. Below MLWL Mytilus edulis (the Blue mussel) was found to be the dominating species after a few months. In the dense layer of M. edulis on both pole hulas and pontoon hulas many mobile soft-bottom amphipods and young ragworms occurred, which means that colonisation on these structures compensate for biodiversity loss of bottom fauna due to dredging and disturbance by propellers of ships. Settlement of the exotic Crassostrea gigas (Pacific or Japanese oyster) did not occur on the strings of the pole hulas, the ropes of the pontoon hulas and not on the poles with hulas.Wet biomass (including shells) on pole hulas was positively correlated with depth and on average 4.4-11.4 times higher compared to biomass on reference poles. Colonization of the pontoon hula ropes was similar to colonization of the pole hulas below MLWL. Biomass production per rope was density dependent and optimal density of ropes was estimated at 4-8ropesm -2. Biomass (mainly M. edulis) on the ropes of pontoon hulas decreased to a half from the edge to the heart of the hula demonstrating the limitation of food by competition.It was concluded that ecological engineering in the port of Rotterdam with simple structures such as pole and pontoon hulas strongly enhances sessile biological production and biodiversity. This is likely to result in a positive impact on local water quality, and, if applied at larger scales, may have positive influences on the remains of Rhine-Meuse estuary. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The focus is to connect business success with social and ecological progress based on the operative concept of multifunctional land use. Such an approach attempts to harmonise the needs of the industrial processes of photovoltaic systems and the ecological and social needs of the landscape context. Different from the usual design of ground photovoltaic systems in farmlands or brownfields, a new framework is proposed, combining photovoltaic panels and vegetation. A case study is considered, applying the framework to existing photovoltaic systems in the Apulia region (southern Italy). The analysis shows how the framework has, among others, the major functions of increasing solar energy production, recycling wastewater, creating raw material for biofuel, as well as providing animal habitat and mitigating air temperature. The latter is preliminarily evaluated by means of modelling simulations performed with a computational fluid dynamics and microclimate model, ENVI-met. This approach opens up a new vision of the infrastructure design of photovoltaic systems which can produce new social and economic income.},

@article{Perkol-Finkel2018,
	abstract = {With nearly 60{\%} of the human population concentrated around the coastlines, alongside growing threats from sea level rise and increased storminess, accelerated coastal development is inevitable. As most marine flora and fauna reside in coastal areas, anthropogenic changes to coastlines are a key reason for loss of coastal habitats, and associated ecosystem services. While coastal infrastructure such as seawalls or breakwaters add significant amounts of hard substrate for marine organisms, they do not support similar species assemblages to those of natural habitats. This is mainly due to design features related to steep slopes, low structural complexity, and high homogeneity, all of which are rarely found in natural habitats. This study provides an example for seascape architecture of coastal structures using ecologically sensitive designs and concrete technologies that enhance the structures' biological and ecological value while contributing to structural integrity. Four 1.5 mx0.8 m seawall panels made of bio-enhancing concrete with high structural complexity were deployed in an active marina (Herzliya, Israel). The panels, spanned from the Mean High Higher Water (MHHW) down to the sublittoral zone, were surveyed 2, 7, 12, 18 and 22 months post deployment using 0.3 × 0.3 m quadrats in both intertidal and sublittoral zones of each panel. Bio-enhanced panels were compared to fixed control quadrats comprised of scraped sections of the original concrete marina seawall. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of applying ecological considerations for biological and ecological enhancement of active infrastructure. All community parameters examined (live cover, richness, biodiversity) were significantly higher on bio-enhanced panels compared to controls. Moreover, mobile invertebrates and resident fish species were clearly enhanced through design aspects (holes and crevices) of the bio-enhanced panels. The study provides an example of an emerging approach of assimilating ecological considerations into the design and construction of working waterfronts and active coastal infrastructure, thus reducing their ecological footprint without compromising their operational performance.},

This interaction can provide additional incentives to encourage local communities' long-term cooperation in conserving and protecting the restored forest ecosystems. Hydroelectricity plants also obtain benefits from this interaction. The industrialization of ecosystem services supply provides an operational framework for this beneficial interaction.

	abstract = {Green infrastructure (GI) is a strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas with other environmental features designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services. It incorporates green spaces (or blue if aquatic ecosystems are concerned) and other physical features in terrestrial (including coastal) and marine areas. On land, GI is present in rural and urban settings. In addition to providing a key tool to halt and reverse the loss of biodiversity, this network of biodiversity-rich green (land) and blue (water) spaces, provides simultaneously a multiplicity of benefits in a cost-efficient way. The delivery of those benefits is maximised if planned at a strategic level. The Action Plan for Nature, People and the Economy aims to improve the practical implementation of the EU nature legislation and accelerate progress towards the EU 2020 goal of halting and reversing the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Acknowledging the positive contribution that green and blue infrastructure can bring to the implementation of the EU Nature legislation and to the achievement of the EU biodiversity strategy to 2020, Action 12 of this Action Plan foresees the development of a guidance providing a strategic framework for further supporting the deployment of EU-level green infrastructure so as to enhance the delivery of essential ecosystem services throughout the EU territory. This guidance implements this action, and seeks to encourage the scaling-up of investments in EU-level GI projects, avoiding that there are only a few independent initiatives that do not deliver the full potential. It aims to stimulate a more strategic and integrated approach to GI, so as to maximise the delivery of ecosystem services and the EU added value, using the Natura 2000 network as its backbone. It also aims at providing information on the relevant existing funding sources and supporting tools. This guidance contributes to establishing a strategic framework to support EU-level green and blue infrastructure projects to maximise the benefits provided. It should contribute to restoring and better connecting functional ecosystems and to improving the connectivity of the Natura 2000 network and other areas of high value for biodiversity that are fragmented or isolated. It should also contribute to fostering the integration of ecosystem services in EU policies and supporting funding instruments, and it complements the dedicated guidance on integrating ecosystems and their services in planning and decision-making also foreseen under the Action Plan.},

Design procedures generally utilize open channel flow equations, and hydrologic and hydraulic routing equations. Hydraulic capacity, conveyance and evacuation of ilood flows have been the primary objectives in system design. some hydraulic structures have damaged aquatic habitats. To obtain environmental sustainability, there is now increased pressure ro ensure that ecological factors are considered in river basin development and management projects. The above computational methods, as well as compurer simulation models of river hydraulics lack ecological parameters. waterways including large international rivers such as the Nile are unique ecosystems, which provide habitats for aquatic biota. Therefore, hydrologic and hydraulic modifications to waterways should seek to protect and enhance aquatic species. This paper outlines the ecological variables that ought to be considered in the design and management of waterways. The need to maintain meanders, and certain channel shaoes, slooes and depths are discussed. lt is important to protect and encourage certain iypes ot vegetation for fish habitats. Methods of incorporating water quality objectives are also presented.

	abstract = {A new surface runoff treatment system has been designed for London Heathrow Airport, which incorporates separate floating constructed wetlands or reedbeds and sub-surface flow constructed wetlands as major pollutant removal systems. The primary requirement of the newly developed treatment system is to control the concentrations of glycols following their use as de-icers and anti-icers within the airport. The ability of reedbeds to contribute to this treatment role was fully tested through pilot scale, on-site experiments over a 2 year period. The average reductions in runoff BOD concentrations achieved by pilot scale surface flow and sub-surface flow reedbeds were 30.9{\%} and 32.9{\%}, respectively. The corresponding average glycol removal efficiencies were 54.2{\%} and 78.3{\%}, following shock dosing inputs. These treatment performances are used to predict the required full scale constructed wetland surface areas needed to attain the desired effluent water quality. The treatment system also incorporates aeration, storage and, combined with reedbed technology, has been designed to reduce a mixed inlet BOD concentration of 240 mg/l to less than 40 mg/l for water temperatures varying between 6$\,^{\circ}$C and 20$\,^{\circ}$C.},

Income is increasingly derived from non-aeronautical sources and airports are sites for the consumption of a range of goods and services. They are also shown to be personal and social spaces and a type of attraction where culture and heritage are displayed. In addition, airports have a political dimension and are instruments of government policy, as well as representatives of the city and country in which they are located. The focus of this research is on the city state of Singapore and Changi Airport which is a leading Asian and global air traffic center. Its case is examined and illustrates these trends while reflecting Singapore's unique characteristics. General insights are afforded into the multiple meanings and purposes of airports in the current era, alongside the existing and future challenges inherent in balancing roles to be performed and succeeding in a highly competitive market.},

@article{Black2016,
	abstract = {Abstract-Global warming poses particular challenges for urban areas due to the greater intensity of rainfall and issues of stormwater runoff, and the heat island effect generated by the reflection of the sun off hard surfaces, such as buildings and road pavements; for example, in Australian cities (i.e., Sydney), roads account for approximately 25{\%} of all urban land use. The challenge for road authorities is to implement green infrastructure in road planning, design and implementation as the term ``green infrastructure'' has appeared increasingly throughout the world in land management and planning. Despite these environmental challenges, traditional highway engineering practices use arguments regarding the economic inefficiencies of urban traffic congestion to justify the business case for road-widening schemes and new road construction projects with associated de-forestation and vegetation loss. An international literature review and site visits of green infrastructure best practice in Australia, Singapore, the U.K. and the USA is reported. A typical road authority project is described in Sydney, Australia, where the initial design concept to accommodate growth in all modes of transport was road widening and land acquisition, but the authors persuaded the local and state government authorities to consider other options to ``green'' the infrastructure, particularly opportunities to add trees and vegetation near the roadway, which provide the additional bonus of managing surface water runoff. From this general problem, the case for, and value to, road authorities to develop green infrastructure guidelines for project planning and implementation, are presented. The conclusions include ongoing research to formulate draft guidelines for governments based on a holistic approach to the planning and design of high-density urban development around transport nodes that includes green infrastructure principles.},

Based on a quantitative approach, our findings provided insight that a green physical environment affected the psychological resilience considerably. Moreover, such association increased a visitor's positive attitude, satisfaction, and brand-self connection with the creation of loyalty intentions. The prominent role of attitude in building loyalty intentions was unearthed. Our finding from a metric invariance test further showed that gender moderated the magnitude of the effect of satisfaction and brand-self connection on loyalty intentions. The study variables' role of mediating effect was also recognizable. Overall, the present study demonstrated the criticality of a green built environment and its role in explicating visitor responses/behaviors in the airport context in a successful manner.},

To that end, the researcher has: Studied the medical and psychological impact of flight on human condition; considered the creation and maintenance of greenspaces from the standpoint of botany; analyzed the existing closed greenspaces at airports, their pros and cons; proposed solutions to identified problems; analyzed various layouts for such greenspaces and projected the microclimate they might have; developed a concept and proposed a working model for stand-alone airport greenspace. The paper analyzes a pilot design and proposes the basic principles behind airport-based psychophysical recreation areas: Special plants for better microclimate; comfortable visuals, i.e. harmonious and non-aggressive interiors; use of greenspace to mitigate the stress the airport environment subjects human beings to; airport greenspacing on the basis of space classification; layout optimization, i.e. functional zoning of greenspaces, with special areas being arranged for crew members, arriving and departing passengers, and passengers of different age groups. Spatial layouts, engineering, and designs may vary to better fit the purpose. Thus, a single closed greenspace instance may comprise multiple modules to serve different use cases. One mandatory feature is accessibility for persons with reduced mobility combined with special communication means for persons with disabilities.},

	abstract = {The operation and longevity of hydropower dams are often negatively impacted by sedimentation. Forest conservation can reduce soil erosion, and therefore efforts to maintain upstream forest cover within a watershed contribute to the economic life span of a hydropower facility. The cost of forest conservation can be viewed as an investment in hydropower and be financed via a payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme. A novel modelling framework is used to estimate payments for forest conservation consisting of: (1) land-use change projection; (2) watershed erosion modelling; (3) reservoir sedimentation estimation; (4) power generation loss calculation; and (5) PES scheme design. The framework was applied to a proposed dam in Cambodia (Pursat 1). The estimated net present value of forest conservation was US{\$} 4.7 million when using average annual climate values over 100 years, or US{\$} 6.4 million when considering droughts every eight years. This can be remunerated with annual payments of US{\$} 4.26 ha?1 or US{\$} 5.78 ha?1, respectively, covering forest protection costs estimated at US{\$} 0.9 ha?1 yr?1. The application of this type of PES represents a rational option that allows for conservation and development of hydropower watersheds susceptible to erosion and sedimentation. {\textcopyright} Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2011.},

	abstract = {The main objective of sanitation systems is to protect and promote human health by providing a clean environment and breaking the cycle of disease. In order to be sustainable, a sanitation system has to be not only economically viable, socially acceptable and technically and institutionally appropriate, but it should also protect the environment and the natural resources. 'Resources-oriented sanitation' describes the approach in which human excreta and water from households are recognized as resource made available for reuse. Nowadays, 'resources-oriented sanitation' is understood in the same way as 'ecological sanitation'. For resources-oriented sanitation systems to be truly sustainable they have to comply with the definition of sustainable sanitation as given by the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA, www.susana.org). Constructed treatment wetlands meet the basic criteria of sustainable sanitation systems by preventing diseases, protecting the environment, and being an affordable, acceptable, and simple technology. Additionally, constructed treatment wetlands produce treated wastewater of high quality, which is fostering reuse, which in turn makes them applicable in resources-oriented sanitation systems. The paper discusses the features that make constructed treatment wetlands a suitable solution in sustainable resourcesoriented sanitation systems, the importance of system thinking for sustainability, as well as key factors for sustainable implementation of constructed wetland systems. {\textcopyright} IWA Publishing 2013.},

	abstract = {Leachates are wastewater generated principally from landfills and solid waste disposal sites. Leachates emanating from municipal wastes are a major source of surface and groundwater pollution worldwide. Globally, leachates have been implicated in low yield of farm produce, developmental anomalies, low birth weights, leukemia incidence, and other cancers in communities around the site. They have also been implicated in hazards to the environment, loss of biodiversity, and contamination of water sources. At Aba-Eku in Nigeria, leachates are being discharged into the Omi Stream without treatment. A study was conducted on a method of leachate treatment that passes the leachate through constructed wetlands using Ipomoea aquatica (Forsk), a locally available plant found close to the landfill site. The aim of the study was to evolve a sustainable and cost-effective method of treatment whose effluents can be discharged into the Omi Stream with no or minimal impact. The study was descriptive and analytical in design. Samples were collected and analyzed with standard methods for pH, suspended solids (SS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia, nitrate, and trace metals. Raw leachates were turbid and amber in color and contained suspended solids (197.5 mg/L), ammonia (610.9 mg/L), lead (1.64 mg/L), iron (198.10 mg/L), and manganese (23.20 mg/L). When the leachates were passed through the constructed wetland with eight hours' detention time, effluents showed significant reductions in suspended solids (81.01 percent), BOD (86.03 percent), and ammonia (97.77 percent). The study shows that a constructed wetland is a feasible tool for the treatment of leachates before their disposal into the environment in Nigeria and can help safeguard environmental quality.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, it is better understood that the benefits of green infrastructure include a series of ecosystem services, such as cooling, water storage and management, recreation and landscaping, among others. Green technologies are still developing to provide sustainable solutions to the problems that modern cities and peri-urban areas face at an ever-increasing rate and intensity. Constructed wetlands technology is an established green multi-purpose option for water management and wastewater treatment, with numerous effectively proven applications around the world and multiple environmental and economic advantages. These systems can function as water treatment plants, habitat creation sites, urban wildlife refuges, recreational or educational facilities, landscape engineering and ecological art areas. The aim of this article is to highlight the synergies between this green technology and urban areas in order to reconnect cities with nature, to promote circularity in the urban context and to apply innovative wetland designs as landscape infrastructure and water treatment solutions. This approach could be a step further in the effort to mitigate the current degradation process of the urban landscape. Following the concept of green infrastructure, the article presents and suggests ways to integrate wetland technology in the urban environment, namely: (i) stormwater and urban runoff management (storage and treatment of water during storm events) to provide protection from flood incidents, especially considering climate change, (ii) innovative low-impact infrastructure and design solutions for urban wastewater treatment, and (iii) wetland technology for habitat creation and ecosystem services provision.},

@article{Lamb2013,
	abstract = {Landfill remains the predominant means of waste disposal throughout the globe. Numerous landfills exist in developed and underdeveloped countries, engineered with contrasting degrees of effectiveness. Modern landfill closure in developed countries involves the conventional capping of waste with materials such as compacted clay or geosynthetic clay liners, typically overlain with other soil materials. Conventional capping technologies are now accepted to be increasingly ineffective in reducing percolation into waste. Cost-effective alternative systems are of increasing interest, including the use of plants to control and limit water entry into waste, otherwise known as "Phytocapping". Phytocapping reduces percolation through three main mechanisms: (a) canopy interception of rainfall, (b) storage of moisture in the soil layers, and (c) evapotranspiration (i.e., hydraulic lift) of stored water. Phytocapping has been shown to be at least as effective as clay capping in reducing percolation through landfill cover materials, provided site specific conditions are factored into design, and providing many additional benefits, including increased cap stability, reduced erosion of capping materials, reduction of wind-blown dust, enhanced biological diversity, increased opportunity to establish commercial plants, carbon sequestration, and enhanced methane oxidation from microbial communities. Phytocapping has been suggested as having potential in phytoremediation of landfill leachate. The most common phytocapping approach to date is the construction of vegetation assemblages for the purposes of creating natural vegetation nodes. Phytocapping technology can be enhanced by appropriate selection of soil amendments such as biosolids, biochar, compost, or other materials. Appropriate selection of plant species and soil amendment products can enhance methane oxidation in capping soils. There is considerable potential for the use of high biomass energy plants but further work is needed in choosing appropriate plant species that will serve both purposes of site water balance as well as commercial (e.g., timber, bioenergy) and biodiversity needs of the community. {\textcopyright} 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Green roofs have the potential to improve the thermal performance of a roofing system through shading, insulation, evapotranspiration and thermal mass, thus reducing a building's energy demand for space conditioning. To quantify the thermal performance and energy efficiency of green roofs in Canada, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) has constructed an experimental facility, the Field Roof Facility (FRF), in its Ottawa campus. A median divider separates the roof of the FRF in two equal areas: a generic extensive green roof and a modified bituminous roof. Both roof sections are instrumented to allow direct comparison of the thermal performance the Green Roof and the Reference Roof. Observations from the FRF showed that a generic extensive green roof could reduce the temperature and the daily temperature fluctuation experienced by the roof membrane significantly in the warmer months (spring and summer). The Green Roof also significantly moderated the heat flow through the roofing system and reduced the average daily energy demand for space conditioning due to the heat flow through the roof in the summer by more than 75{\%}. The Green Roof was more effective in reducing heat gain than heat loss.},

@misc{Karteris2016,
	abstract = {In the Mediterranean area, rural abandonment and the rapid urbanisation after the 1950's have led to complex environmental problems, such as the exploitation of natural resources, the environmental pollution and the rapid increase of greenhouse gas emissions. Especially the unrestrained urban growth caused excessive pressure on the existing infrastructure, which affects buildings, public transportation, road networks, water quality, waste collection and public health. Green roofs are emerging building technologies that can help communities mitigate some of the above mentioned problems. Various studies have demonstrated that the implementation of green roof technology can moderate some of these environmental problems, through the reduction of heat flux and solar reflectivity, the minimisation of heat losses through the building's envelope, the air pollution removal, the storm water runoff reduction, the air cooling as well as the effective management of the urban heat island effect. In this line of thought, the aim of this study is to assess the green roof potential and the quantification of its benefits over Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. To delineate the available green roof areas, very high spatial resolution satellite image and natural colour orthoimagery were used along with a geographical object-based image analysis approach. Potential green roof extent was extracted with a mean error of 8.78 m2, and discriminated from staircases, penthouse setbacks and terracotta tiles. Subsequently GIS were used to extrapolate the results from the building to the city scale. Carbon sequestration potential, rainwater retention and energy conservation were estimated based on coefficients adopted after a comprehensive literature review and actual dynamic energy simulations. The green roof potential in Thessaloniki approximated 17{\%} of the gross built areas of the city, which means that there is a strong potential for green roof retrofit. Depending on the vegetation type installed in an extensive green roof, C stocks in Thessaloniki can increase by 2.5 times, while the dynamic energy simulations suggested that in certain city blocks reduced heating and cooling consumptions up to 5{\%} and 16{\%} respectively could be achieved. In regard to rainwater retention, implementation of green roofs in Thessaloniki is estimated to contribute in rainwater retention by almost 45{\%}, allowing more than half of the rainwater precipitation to be reserved at the 50{\%} of the city blocks.},

	abstract = {A new surface runoff treatment system has been designed for London Heathrow Airport, which incorporates separate floating constructed wetlands or reedbeds and sub-surface flow constructed wetlands as major pollutant removal systems. The primary requirement of the newly developed treatment system is to control the concentrations of glycols following their use as de-icers and anti-icers within the airport. The ability of reedbeds to contribute to this treatment role was fully tested through pilot scale, on-site experiments over a 2 year period. The average reductions in runoff BOD concentrations achieved by pilot scale surface flow and sub-surface flow reedbeds were 30.9{\%} and 32.9{\%}, respectively. The corresponding average glycol removal efficiencies were 54.2{\%} and 78.3{\%}, following shock dosing inputs. These treatment performances are used to predict the required full scale constructed wetland surface areas needed to attain the desired effluent water quality. The treatment system also incorporates aeration, storage and, combined with reedbed technology, has been designed to reduce a mixed inlet BOD concentration of 240 mg/l to less than 40 mg/l for water temperatures varying between 6$\,^{\circ}$C and 20$\,^{\circ}$C.},

Before and after their walk, participants completed a series of psychological assessments of affective and cognitive functioning. Compared to the urban walk, the nature walk resulted in affective benefits (decreased anxiety, rumination, and negative affect, and preservation of positive affect) as well as cognitive benefits (increased working memory performance). This study extends previous research by demonstrating additional benefits of nature experience on affect and cognition through assessments of anxiety, rumination, and a complex measure of working memory (operation span task). These findings further our understanding of the influence of relatively brief nature experiences on affect and cognition, and help to lay the foundation for future research on the mechanisms underlying these effects.},

	abstract = {Since the 1960's green movement, green roofs have 're-emerged' as a viable solution to address pressing environmental issues like increased storm water runoff, the urban heat island effect, deterioration of air and water quality, and loss of habitat and biodiversity facing urban centres. Increasingly becoming popular worldwide, green roofs are still not an area local builders are keen to take on. Despite the availability of materials and suitability of climate here, they are held back partly by concerns pertaining to costs. The objectives of this study are to highlight the economic benefits of green roofs that can offset the initial costs; to examine the initial cost implications of having a green roof as compared to a conventional flat roof; to compute and compare the life cycle costs of roof gardens and average flat roofs; and to incorporate economic benefits by incorporating energy costs into life cycle costs. It is observed that life cycle costs of extensive green roofs with or without consideration for energy costs, are lower than that of exposed flat roofs, despite its higher initial costs. However, for accessible rooftops, even life cycle (energy) costs of intensive system are not less than the normal build-up flat roof. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Stenfors2019,
	abstract = {Interactions with natural environments and nature-related stimuli have been found to be beneficial to cognitive performance, in particular on executive cognitive tasks with high demands on directed attention processes. However, results vary across different studies. The aim of the present paper was to evaluate the effects of nature vs. urban environments on cognitive performance across all of our published and new/unpublished studies testing the effects of different interactions with nature vs. urban/built control environments, on an executive-functioning test with high demands on directed attention-the backwards digit span (BDS) task. Specific aims in this study were to: (1) evaluate the effect of nature vs. urban environment interactions on BDS across different exposure types (e.g., real-world vs. artificial environments/stimuli); (2) disentangle the effects of testing order (i.e., effects caused by the order in which experimental conditions are administered) from the effects of the environment interactions, and (3) test the (mediating) role of affective changes on BDS performance. To this end, data from 13 experiments are presented, and pooled data-analyses are performed. Results from the pooled data-analyses (N = 528 participants) showed significant time-by-environment interactions with beneficial effects of nature compared to urban environments on BDS performance. There were also clear interactions with the order in which environment conditions were tested. Specifically, there were practice effects across environment conditions in first sessions. Importantly, after parceling out initial practice effects, the positive effects of nature compared to urban interactions on BDS performance were magnified. Changes in positive or negative affect did not mediate the beneficial effects of nature on BDS performance. These results are discussed in relation to the findings of other studies identified in the literature. Uncontrolled and confounding order effects (i.e., effects due to the order of experimental conditions, rather than the treatment conditions) may explain some of the inconsistent findings across studies in the literature on nature effects on cognitive performance. In all, these results highlight the robustness of the effects of natural environments on cognition, particularly when confounding order effects have been considered, and provide a more nuanced account of when a nature intervention will be most effective.},

It focuses on papers that provide examples of how biodiversity components (that is, ecosystems, species and genes) directly deliver benefits that may contribute to the achievement of individual SDGs. It also considers how biodiversity's direct contributions to fulfilling some SDGs may indirectly support the achievement of other SDGs to which biodiversity does not contribute directly. How the attributes (for example, diversity, abundance or composition) of biodiversity components influence the benefits delivered is also presented, where described by the papers reviewed. While acknowledging potential negative impacts and trade-offs between different benefits, the study concludes that biodiversity may contribute to fulfilment of all SDGs.},

	abstract = {[ABSTRACT. Nature-based solutions promoting green and blue urban areas have significant potential to decrease the vulnerability and enhance the resilience of cities in light of climatic change. They can thereby help to mitigate climate change-induced impacts and serve as proactive adaptation options for municipalities. We explore the various contexts in which nature-based solutions are relevant for climate mitigation and adaptation in urban areas, identify indicators for assessing the effectiveness of nature-based solutions and related knowledge gaps. In addition, we explore existing barriers and potential opportunities for increasing the scale and effectiveness of nature-based solution implementation. The results were derived from an inter- and transdisciplinary workshop with experts from research, municipalities, policy, and society. As an outcome of the workshop discussions and building on existing evidence, we highlight three main needs for future science and policy agendas when dealing with nature-based solutions: (i) produce stronger evidence on nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation and raise awareness by increasing implementation; (ii) adapt for governance challenges in implementing nature-based solutions by using reflexive approaches, which implies bringing together new networks of society, nature-based solution ambassadors, and practitioners; (iii) consider socio-environmental justice and social cohesion when implementing nature-based solutions by using integrated governance approaches that take into account an integrative and transdisciplinary participation of diverse actors. Taking these needs into account, nature-based solutions can serve as climate mitigation and adaptation tools that produce additional cobenefits for societal well-being, thereby serving as strong investment options for sustainable urban planning.]},

@book{LivingPlanetReport2020,
	abstract = {This report describes the changing state of global biodiversity and the pressure on the biosphere arising from human consumption of natural resources. It is built around two indicators: the Living Planet Index, which reflects the health of the planet's ecosystems; and the Ecological Footprint, which shows the extent of human demand on these ecosystems. These measures are tracked over several decades to reveal past trends, then three scenarios explore what might lie ahead. The scenarios show how the choices we make might lead to a sustainable society living in harmony with robust ecosystems, or to the collapse of these same ecosystems, resulting in a permanent loss of biodiversity and erosion of the planet's ability to support people. The Living Planet Index measures trends in the Earth's biological diversity. It tracks populations of 1 313 vertebrate species -- fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals -- from all around the world. Separate indices are produced for terrestrial, marine, and freshwater species, and the three trends are then averaged to create an aggregated index. Although vertebrates represent only a fraction of known species, it is assumed that trends in their populations are typical of biodiversity overall. By tracking wild species, the Living Planet Index is also monitoring the health of ecosystems. Between 1970 and 2003, the index fell by about 30 per cent. This global trend suggests that we are degrading natural ecosystems at a rate unprecedented in human history. WWFbegan its Living Planet Reports in 1998 to show the state of the natural world and the impact of human activity upon it. Since then we have continuously refined and developed our measures of the state of the Earth. And it is not good news. The Living Planet Report 2006 confirms that we are using the planet's resources faster than they can be renewed -- the latest data available (for 2003) indicate that humanity's Ecological Footprint, our impact upon the planet, has more than tripled since 1961. Our footprint now exceeds the world's ability to regenerate by about 25 per cent. The consequences of our accelerating pressure on Earth's natural systems are both predictable and dire. The other index in this report, the Living Planet Index, shows a rapid and continuing loss of biodiversity -- populations of vertebrate species have declined by about one third since 1970. This confirms previous trends. The message of these two indices is clear and urgent: we have been exceeding the Earth's ability to support our lifestyles for the past 20 years, and we need to stop. We must balance our consumption with the natural world's capacity to regenerate and absorb our wastes. If we do not, we risk irreversible damage. We know where to start. The biggest contributor to our footprint is the way in which we generate and use energy. The Living Planet Report indicates that our reliance on fossil fuels to meet our energy needs continues to grow and that climate-changing emissions now make up 48 per cent -- almost half -- of our global footprint. We also know, from this report, that the challenge of reducing our footprint goes to the very heart of our current models for economic development. Comparing the Ecological Footprint with a recognized measure of human development, the United Nations Human Development Index, the report clearly shows that what we currently accept as ``high development'' is a long way away from the world's stated aim of sustainable development. As countries improve the wellbeing of their people, they are bypassing the goal of sustainability and going into what we call ``overshoot'' -- using far more resources than the planet can sustain. It is inevitable that this path will limit the abilities of poor countries to develop and of rich countries to maintain prosperity. It is time to make some vital choices. Change that improves living standards while reducing our impact on the natural world will not be easy. But we must recognize that choices we make now will shape our opportunities far into the future. The cities, power plants, and homes we build today will either lock society into damaging overconsumption beyond our lifetimes, or begin to propel this and future generations towards sustainable living. The good news is that this can be done. We already have technologies that can lighten our footprint, including many that can significantly reduce climate-threatening carbon dioxide emissions. And some are getting started. WWF is working with leading companies that are taking action to reduce the footprint -- cutting carbon emissions, and promoting sustainability in other sectors, from fisheries to forests. We are also working with governments who are striving to stem biodiversity loss by protecting vital habitats on an unprecedented scale. But we must all do more. The message of the Living Planet Report 2006 is that we are living beyond our means, and that the choices each of us makes today will shape the possibilities for the generations which follow us.
