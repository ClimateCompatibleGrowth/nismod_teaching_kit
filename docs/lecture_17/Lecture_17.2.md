## Overview of the applications of nature-based solutions in waste and wastewater treatment

As the population grows, the challenges of waste and wastewater
treatment increases; the generation of waste and wastewater is vast and
new types of contamination are emerging. While engineering approaches
are used for effectively and safely treating the contamination, a
significant portion of waste and wastewater are still entering the
environment without treatment. For example, in western Europe 86% of
wastewater is treated, in North America it's 67%, and in south Asia and
sub-Saharan Arica only 16% of it is treated [@Jones2021]. Pollution
from the waste and wastewater sectors, when in excess of the intrinsic
self-regulating capability of environments, will build up in the
environment and eventually impair ecosystem health and undermine human
well-being.

While engineering approaches are key to treating waste and wastewater
and to minimising the pollution entering the environment, nature-based
solutions provide alternative or complementary approaches. Nature-based
solutions can be more cost-effective in treating certain contaminants
and provide valuable co-benefits. This is especially beneficial for
countries and regions where expensive engineering infrastructures are
not available. Table 17.2.1 provides an overview of applications of
nature-based solutions in waste and wastewater treatment.

## Incorporating nature-based solutions into landfill management

The two most commonly used nature-based solutions in waste treatment
are:

1.  To use constructed wetlands to treat leachate from landfill

2.  To construct natural habitats to restore landfill sites.

Leachate from landfill usually contains high concentrations of various
pollutants including organic matter, nutrients, heavy metals, and salts.
Constructed wetlands are shown to be effective in treating landfill
leachate. @Bakhshoodeh2020 reviewed 85 papers across 20 countries to
examine the performance of different types of constructed wetlands, and
reported:

-   Hybrid constructed wetlands are more effective in removing
    contaminants, showing average removals of 72.2 % for biochemical
    oxygen demand (BOD), 56.2 % for chemical oxygen demand (COD), 61.0 %
    for phosphate (PO~4~), 64.9 % for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN),
    67.3 % for total nitrogen (TN), 68.9 % for ammonia-nitrogen, and
    51.8 ± 29% for total suspended solids (TSS)

-   Vertical flow constructed wetlands are more effective in removing
    heavy metals, showing average removal of 92.4 % for cadmium (Cd),
    90.0 % for chromium (Cr), 93.3 % for nickel (Ni), 84.1 % for lead
    (Pb), 89.3 % for zinc (Zn), 93.6 % for iron (Fe), and 77.1 % for
    manganese (Mn).

Landfill restoration aims to return the land to beneficial use by
placing an even layer of material on top of the landfill. Nature-based
solutions for landfill restoration uses natural systems, such as
grassland, heathland and/or wetland habitats to cap the landfill site
[@Lamb2014]. These habitats can prevent water from entering the
landfill, stabilise the site, and reduce air pollution, improving both
environmental quality and human health [@Simmons1999; @Geniole2016].
Special attention should be paid to the usage of native plants during
the restoration [@Rubin2006]. Native plants can develop into a
self-sustaining landscape by eliminating the need for fertilisers,
pesticides, and irrigation. Native plants also better preserve
biodiversity and the natural heritage as they provide shelter and food
for native wildlife and pollinators.

## Case study: Constructed wetlands treating landfill leachates in Ibadan, Nigeria 

This case study presents the implementation and performance of a
constructed wetland in treating leachate from a landfill site in Ibadan,
Nigeria [@Aluko2005]. Ibadan is the largest indigenous city south of
the Sahara, in tropical Africa, with an estimated population of over
three million. Landfills are the ultimate destination of residual waste
of the city. At the study site, leachates are discharged into the
environment without treatment. To mitigate the harmful impact from such
leachate, a constructed wetland was built.

The wetland was built with a vertical subsurface-flow design with gravel
as the filtration medium. The reactor incorporates layers of 0.2 metres
of coarse- to medium-sized sand on top of supportive layers of 0.5
metres of fine and coarse gravel. The sand layers were planted with
*Ipomoea aquatica* (Forsk), a locally available plant found close to the
landfill site. Leachates were introduced into the site and were allowed
to flow through the system by gravity. Table 17.2.2 shows the
characteristics of the influent and effluents from the constructed
wetlands. The final effluent from the constructed wetlands met the
Nigeria Federal Environmental Protection Agency standard for discharge
into surface waters.

## Nature-based solutions for nutrient removal 

Human activity, mainly agriculture, has substantially increased the flux
of phosphorus into the landscape. Such excessive nutrient inputs into
surface water lead to a decline in water quality, algae blooms, or even
large hypoxic zones in coastal water environments. The majority of
nitrogen and phosphorus pollution is from non-point source, from excess
fertilisers from farmland [@Ongley2010]. They can also come from the
untreated sewage wastewater[@Jones2021], or even from the effluent of
wastewater treatment plants [@MEA2005].

Nature-based solutions can retain nutrients. For example, farmers can
grow perennial crops or grasses rather than annuals such as corn and
soybeans. Perennials retain nitrogen in the rooting zone and greatly
reduce losses to groundwater. Famers can also plant winter cover crops,
which greatly reduce the leaching of nitrate into groundwater during
winter and spring, when most leaching normally occurs.

Nature-based solutions can also remove nutrients from waterbodies.
Approaches include the restoration of water flows through wetlands and
constructing wetlands to intercept with surface or groundwater flow.
Wetlands and ponds that directly intercept groundwater flows or tile
drainage, or have effective water exchange with streams and rivers, are
the greatest sinks of nitrogen, while those that intercept eroding
sediments are most effective for phosphorus.

However, wetlands can release substantial quantities of greenhouse
gases, such as methane (CH~4~) and nitrous oxide (N~2~O), under
anaerobic conditions. CH~4~ and N~2~O have 84 and 298 times higher
global warming potential than CO~2~, respectively, and both also
contribute to ozone depletion. Therefore, when planning for nature-based
solutions, there should be careful consideration to also ensure minimal
production of these greenhouse gases.

## Case study: Floating wetlands treating urban wastewater in Pakistan 

This case study looks at the implementation of a large-scale floating
treatment wetland (FTWs) installed on a wastewater stabilisation pond in
Faisalabad, Pakistan [@Afzal2019]. The ponds were built in 1998 as a
means to treat wastewater from sewage (60%) and industrial (40%)
wastewater. As the city grew, an overloading of the ponds resulted in a
decline in treatment efficiency.

A large-scale FTW system of around 1,858m^2^ was installed in the
existing wastewater stabilisation ponds in 2014, with a ratio of the
FTWs to the pond surface area of 0.035. The whole system consisted of
around 1,000 hydroponic rootmat units (Figure 17.2.1). In a three-year
period of 2014-2016, the FTW was fully established (with helophytic
grasses) and promoted a substantial improvement of all recorded water
quality indicators and a reduction of heavy metal concentrations in the
effluent compared to the influent. The maximum removal capacities of the
system were 79% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 88% of biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) and 65% of total dissolved solids (TDS).

The performance of the FTWs was optimal in 2015 and 2016, during which
about 60 million m^3^ per year of wastewater was treated at a cost of
USD0.00026 per m^3^. Because the FTW have relatively higher initial
capital cost compared to maintenance costs, the treatment cost per unit
volume wastewater is expected to decrease as service times extend. This
study demonstrates that FTW is a cost-effective approach for large-scale
sewage and industrial wastewater treatment, especially for regions with
limited or insufficient wastewater treatment infrastructures.

## Summary

Nature-based solutions provide cost-effective methods for waste and
wastewater treatment. They can treat effluent from existing waste and
wastewater treatment facilities, and are also critical for treating
nutrient pollution. The case studies of using constructed wetlands to
treat leachate from a landfill site in Nigeria and using floating
treatment wetlands to treat urban wastewater in Pakistan have
demonstrated how nature-based solutions can be used to improve the
performance of engineering approaches.
