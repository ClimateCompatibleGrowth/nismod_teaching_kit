This mini-lecture introduces the concept of infrastructure networks. It
also lists the definitions of hazards, exposures and vulnerabilities in
a general context and within the context of infrastructures. The concept
of infrastructure resilience is also introduced in the lecture.

# Learning objectives

-   # Explain the definition and concept of an infrastructure

-   # Define and conceptualise infrastructure risk as a combination of hazard, vulnerability and exposure, showing the role of networks in risk propagations

-   # Explain the relevant definitions in understanding infrastructure resilience.



# Understanding infrastructure networks

This lecture specifically looks at the infrastructures included within
energy, transport, water, waste, and telecommunications sectors.

These infrastructures have been defined as '*the collection and
interconnection of all physical assets and human systems that are
operated in a coordinated way to provide a particular infrastructure
service'* [@Hall2016]. This definition emphasises the importance of
the services that infrastructures provide, such as energy, water,
mobility or data connectivity, which are critical for the survival and
security of societies and economies. Hence, the term *critical
infrastructure* is also used with reference to such systems
[@mann2009strategic].

Critical infrastructures have evolved into large spatially distributed
networks that generally exhibit *multi-scale hierarchical structures*
[@THACKER201730]. We observe such hierarchies, for example: in
electricity networks where larger high-voltage transmission systems
provide power to smaller low-voltage distribution systems.

Infrastructure networks are also typically *interdependent*, which
implies that they affect each other through the exchange of physical
resources, geographic proximity, information exchange, and
socio-economic factors [@Rinaldi2001]. For example,
telecommunications networks cannot function without electricity supply,
and in turn most operations of the electricity networks require
information exchange through a telecommunications network.

We conceptualise the collective representation of the interdependent
hierarchical infrastructure networks as a '*system-of-systems*' that
provides goods and services to individual members of the population,
households, business and industrial installations (see Figure 8.2.1)
[@THACKER201730].

# The notion of hazard exposures, vulnerabilities and risks

    Critical infrastructures are exposed to hazards, which introduce vulnerabilities and risks to such systems. We first provide some definitions here, relevant to developing our understanding of infrastructure risks. All definitions are from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)[@field2014climate].

-   Hazard refers to the possible future occurrence of natural or human-induced physical events that may have adverse effects on vulnerable and exposed elements. For example, a flood that breaches flood defences and damages roads would be classified as a hazard. If there were no breaches and damages, then the same event would not be classified as a hazard. It is a hazard only when it threatens systems.

-   Exposure refers to the inventory of elements in an area in which hazard events may occur. For example, the numbers of houses, roads, railway lines, electricity substations within a flooded area would be considered as exposed to a flooding hazard. 

-   Vulnerability refers to the propensity of exposed elements such as human beings, their livelihoods, and assets to suffer adverse effects when impacted by hazard events. For example, the inability of people to get access to markets because their nearest bridge gets washed away during a flood makes them vulnerable to aflooding hazard. 

-   Risk is a combination of the hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. It is often represented as a probability of occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by the consequences of impacts to vulnerable systems if these events or trends occur [@oppenheimer2015emergent].

# Conceptualising infrastructure layers 

Broadly, all infrastructure networks can be conceptualised as
collections of three types of layers [@THACKER201730;
@pant2018critical]:

> \(1\) *Source layers:* Where resources are generated -- for example,
> power generation sites, rivers and reservoirs for water
>
> \(2\) *Intermediate layers:* Where resources are stored and (or)
> converted to be delivered further downstream -- for example,
> electricity transmission substations and cables, ports, water
> treatment plants
>
> \(3\) *Sink layers:* Which resources are connected to the final
> customers (people, businesses, systems) who receive the infrastructure
> service -- for example, electricity, gas and water distributions
> systems connected to homes, local roads.

Figure 8.2.3. (see next section) shows a graphical representation of a
multi-scale hierarchical infrastructure network. We note that these
layers are not necessarily rigid and in many cases some assets and
layers might serve as source, intermediate and sink -- for example,
transport layers are all sources (origins), intermediates and sinks
(destinations) to facilitate journeys for people and goods.

# Cascading risks through the infrastructure network

Due to the multi-scale hierarchical structures of infrastructure
networks, hazards affect them at multiple locations and scales. The
connectivity between source, intermediate and sink layers plays a
crucial role in controlling and magnifying risks, which is demonstrated
here through Figure 8.2.3 [@pant2018critical].

Here the hazard affecting the source layer asset (A) breaks the flow of
service (A-\>C) to the intermediate layer. But there is another flow of
service (B-\>E-\>C) that keeps the service going. This prevents the
disruption from proceeding further in the network towards customers. But
for another hazard affecting the sink layer assets (H and I) there are
no alternative flows and all flow linkages (shown in dotted lines are
all ineffective), so the customers become vulnerable.

This simple example showcases a very important effect associated with
infrastructure networks -- the *cascading effect*. Cascading is a
process where small initial failures manifest into larger events
[@watts2002simple] -- for example, an electricity substation failure
could knock out telecommunications, water, and railways network using
the electricity, thereby creating a cascading effect of much larger
disruptions than the original failure which was only that of the
electricity substation.

disruption propagation effects seen in multi-scale hierarchical
structures of infrastructure networks [@pant2018critical]

# Infrastructure resilience

To protect against or diminish risks, infrastructure should be
resilient. There are many interpretations and definitions on resilience
and there is a wide literature review on the subject
[@HOSSEINI201647]. Relevant to all resilience frameworks are four
aspects: *anticipate, absorb, adapt and recover*
[@hickford2018resilience].

For infrastructures, the interpretation of these concepts is explained
through Figure 8.2.4 [@PANT2014183].

-   The ability of an infrastructure to anticipate external hazard
    shocks is built into its reliability. For example, making a road
    flood-proof in advance of knowing the severity of floods that could
    affect it.

-   The ability to absorb shocks is reflected in the decrease of level
    of services while some function is still possible, which is also a
    measure of the vulnerability or survivability.

-   The abilities to adapt and recover are reflected in the
    recoverability of the infrastructure systems, which are the results
    of combinations of actions and plans put in place to get the system
    back to its pre-shock failure levels of service.

In the context of a network, two mechanisms by which all the above
aspects of resilience are enhanced include [@hickford2018resilience]:

-   *Robustness:* When the network assets are built to absorb shocks and
    maintain function

-   *Redundancies:* When the networks have alternative routes within or
    connections with other networks to continue the services. For
    example, alternative routes can be used in road networks to bypass a
    damaged road, or electricity backup supply can be provided for
    networks that rely on a continuous supply of electricity.

# Summary

In this lecture, we introduced the concept of infrastructure networks.
We showed how infrastructures exist as interdependent multi-scale
hierarchical infrastructure networks in a system-of-systems that
provides goods and services to individual members of the population,
households, businesses and industrial installations. We also used
existing definitions of hazard, exposure and vulnerability and looked at
them in the context of infrastructure. We showed how the multi-scale
hierarchical structures of infrastructure network play a crucial role in
risk propagation and cascading effects. Finally, we provided a
definition and understanding of resilience that is relevant to
infrastructures. These definitions are very important in understanding
and quantifying infrastructure failures and risks, and how to prepare
systems to be more resilient.
