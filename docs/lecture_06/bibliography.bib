abstract = {Across fields, more sustainable and resilient outcomes are being realized through a whole systems design perspective, which guides decision-makers to consider the entire system affected including interdependent physical and social networks. Although infrastructure is extremely interdependent, consisting of diverse stakeholders and networks, the infrastructure design and construction process is often fragmented. This fragmentation can result in unnecessary tradeoffs, leading to poor outcomes for certain stakeholders and the surrounding environment. A whole systems design perspective would help connect this fragmented industry and lead to more sustainable outcomes. For example, a whole systems design approach to relieve traffic on a highway might see beyond the obvious, but often ineffective, response of adding a new vehicle lane to encourage a solution such as repurposing existing road lanes from automobiles to above-ground "subway" systems. This paper discusses influences to whole systems design and how intentional choice architecture, meaning the way decisions are posed, can nudge decision-makers to employ whole systems design and result in more sustainable infrastructure. By uncovering these influences and organizing them by the social, organizational, and individual levels of the infrastructure design process, this paper provides the needed foundation for interdisciplinary research to help harness these influences through choice architecture and whole systems design for the infrastructure industry.},

abstract = {The occupied Palestinian territories of West Bank and Gaza Strip are currently experiencing many challenges in the provision of infrastructure services for their inhabitants. This includes an undersupply of infrastructure services across multiple sectors – an issue exacerbated by population growth, increasing urbanisation, economic growth and climate change. We address this challenge by providing a systems-based assessment of Palestine's infrastructure requirements and identifying broad strategies for how those needs might be met. This assessment involved four key components including: 1) defining and assessing the current system and planned infrastructure investments; 2) assessing potential future demand for infrastructure services; 3) identifying alternative strategies for future infrastructure provision beyond planned investments; and 4) analysing the performance of each strategy against a series of key performance indicators. Results from the assessment highlight the magnitude of the current and future need for urgent infrastructure investment in Palestine. The most immediate need is to alleviate the water crises in Gaza Strip, which will require at least twice as much water infrastructure investment over the coming decade than is currently in the pipeline, even if the goal is only to achieve the most basic World Health Organisation water availability requirements. To move beyond this protracted state of crises will then require a doubling of investments across all sectors to bring Palestine up to the standards of services already enjoyed by its neighbours. Such investments can have even greater impact on delivery of infrastructure services through the strategic use of interdependencies between infrastructure sectors, such as water re-use and energy-from-waste. In the pursuit of global sustainable development, the systems-based approach presented here provides an important first step in the assessment of infrastructure needs and opportunities for any country. It is particularly important for states like Palestine where key resources, such as water and energy, are so acutely constrained.},

abstract = {Key points • A systematic infrastructure sustainability assessment and planning process is developed at the national level for small islands • Interdependent sector planning is designed to meet challenges faced by SIDS in the energy, water, wastewater, and solid waste sectors • Infrastructure strategies that are aligned with SDG and Paris Agreement targets are more cost-effective in the long-term Abstract Small island developing states face particular challenges to ensure their infrastructure promotes social, economic, and environmental well-being. Closing the achievement gap for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) involves prioritisation and coordination across multiple sectors. With an application to the country of Saint Lucia, this paper develops a stakeholder-driven analysis framework integrating four interdependent infrastructure sectors (electricity, water, wastewater, solid waste). Drawing on extensive consultation with decision-makers in-country-134 stakeholders from 18 government ministries, agencies, academia, or the private sector-the analysis identifies specific interventions that could be implemented over the next decades to meet future needs for sustainable infrastructure services. These interventions are congruent with the government's development plans. Long-term, cross-sectoral portfolios of investments and policies ('strategies') are developed which demonstrably reach the targets of the SDGs and Saint Lucia's emissions reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement. The sequencing of these investments or policies is designed to optimise their efficiency and impact over time, identifying "quick wins" while ensuring that there is sufficient action to provide services in the long term sustainably. A comparison of costs associated with each strategy suggests that accounting for interdependencies and taking a long-term perspective can save costs over the life of infrastructure investments. This process of infrastructure assessment is applicable beyond the small island context, allowing practitioners a means to undertake systematic assessment of a country's future infrastructure needs and to develop appropriate solutions aligned with its national objectives and international commitments.},

abstract = {This study outlines the work carried out on Naples (Italy) as an example of a solid waste management case study that is used to test and validate a much broader strategy, namely the need for appropriate participatory and scientifically sound decision making processes summarised in a Roadmap. The aim of the Roadmap is to support appropriate decision, based on good stakeholder consultancy. The aim being to lead to better and more integrated waste management solutions, which help EU countries to fulfil the legislative requirements at the national level and also lead to the prevention of acceptance conflicts at the local level. Results arise from research carried out in the frame of an European project, where the viability of a demo plant to produce biomass fuel is evaluated in terms of technical feasibility, socio-economic benefits and environmental care to provide better decisions for appropriate waste management process. The innovative waste management technology produces a high quality biogenic refuse recovered biomass fuel (RRBF) from the MSW. The city of Naples, characterized by heated conflicts around waste management policies, was chosen as a case study to assess the application of both the technology and the decision-making roadmap. Further research work will then be made using Naples a reference case study for additional cross-cultural assessments in other EU countries. Identification and linkages in a 9-step tool kit has been made. The first analyses of stakeholder responses indicate that the respondents trust the potentially good performance of the proposed new technology however further tool kit assessment steps must be adopted to evaluate responses and final decision taken. A large number of stakeholders were in favor of the new presented technology, and consider that this solution is the most likely to solve the waste management in Naples (69% replied “yes”, 29% “maybe”, and 2% are not convinced at all). Providing a suitable, well-tailored technical solution is of paramount importance as a the starting point, but other factors/assessment tools need to be used in order to really solve the problems of meeting EU requirements on landfill if we are to present sustainable solutions that may be accepted by the stakeholders.},

Each Transformation identifies priority investments and regulatory challenges, calling for actions by well-defined parts of government work- ing with business and civil society. Transformations may therefore be operationalized within the structures of government while respecting the strong interdependencies across the 17 SDGs.

abstract = {This paper summarizes the development process and main characteristics of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), a set of four new pathways developed for the climate modeling community as a basis for long-term and near-term modeling experiments. The four RCPs together span the range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i. e. from 2.6 to 8.5 W/m2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts. The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100. Land use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are reported mostly at a 0.5 × 0.5 degree spatial resolution, with air pollutants also provided per sector (for well-mixed gases, a coarser resolution is used). The underlying integrated assessment model outputs for land use, atmospheric emissions and concentration data were harmonized across models and scenarios to ensure consistency with historical observations while preserving individual scenario trends. For most variables, the RCPs cover a wide range of the existing literature. The RCPs are supplemented with extensions (Extended Concentration Pathways, ECPs), which allow climate modeling experiments through the year 2300. The RCPs are an important development in climate research and provide a potential foundation for further research and assessment, including emissions mitigation and impact analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

Although progress in achieving a more sustainable development has been made in some areas, overall, actions have not been able to bend the trend in critical areas (including those related to the so-called food-water-energy nexus). Here, we analyze how different combinations of technological measures and behavioral changes could contribute to achieving a set of sustainability objectives, taking into account the interlinkages between them. The objectives include eradicating hunger, providing universal access to modern energy, preventing dangerous climate change, conserving biodiversity and controlling air pollution. The analysis identifies different pathways that achieve these objectives simultaneously, but they all require substantial transformations in the energy and food systems, that go far beyond historic progress and currently formulated policies. The analysis also shows synergies and trade-offs between achieving the different objectives, concluding that achieving them requires a comprehensive approach. The scenario analysis does not point at a fundamental trade-off between the objectives related to poverty eradication and those related to environmental sustainability. The different pathways of achieving the set of long-term objectives and their implications for short-term action can contribute to building a comprehensive strategy to meet the SDGs by proposing near-term actions.},

abstract = {Sustainable development is widely recognised as a major change challenge, though its urgency is not as widely appreciated. This article begins by reviewing the challenge and showing how it is not currently being taken up. Drawing on the wider literature, it identifies some of the key contextual issues that need to be addressed in change programmes for sustainability. It then develops a simple model of three conditions, ‘awareness', ‘agency' (the identification of meaningful ways of responding) and ‘association' with other people, whose development is shown to be crucial in addressing these issues and hence to promoting change for sustainable development. It also identifies a vital process (‘action and reflection') for doing this. The article concludes with a case example, using this model to review a change initiative in the corporate sector.},

The study created a space for constructive face-to-face dialogue in a community historically characterised by land use conflict. The sharing of scenarios through storytelling, helped bridge epistemic and cultural divides and created shared narratives of the future. Scenarios were place-based and focused on transforming the economy towards sustainability, and enabling political and economic reconciliation between First Nations (Indigenous peoples) and non-First Nations peoples. This approach fostered social learning, and strengthened networks across groups. The involvement of change-makers to action policy pathways was important for advancing post-workshop cooperation, and catalyzed meaningful steps towards reconciliation.},

abstract = {Where power lies and how it is conceived in studies of governance and institutions is often not discussed. This is due to the ubiquitous nature of the topic. Power is shaped by a variety of institutional factors, including the architecture of governing structures, questions of scale and level, and access to key resources including knowledge and capital, among other factors. To date, there are relatively few tools available that allow policy makers, researchers, and development practitioners to render these power dynamics explicit and thus take steps to mitigate the potentially deleterious effects of power ori-entations. This paper proposes a methodology, multi-level stakeholder influence mapping (MSIM), for elucidating power dynamics between actors in complex system regimes. MSIM departs from existing power mapping techniques in that it relies on individual interviews conducted across multiple actor levels and utilizes a participatory mapping process for shared system boundary critique. MSIM was piloted in Nepal's agricultural climate change adaptation regime with actors from the central, regional, and local oper-ational levels. The results suggest that without proper consideration of the role of power in agricultural adaptation regimes, the resulting interventions will likely be insufficient in catalyzing adaptation pathways and moderating the negative impacts of climate change. Furthermore, power analyses produced from the perspective of a single actor level or respondent type can risk sub optimization of adaptation outcomes and can misdirect the lobbying efforts of those agencies utilizing mapping outputs.},

abstract = {Key points • A systematic infrastructure sustainability assessment and planning process is developed at the national level for small islands • Interdependent sector planning is designed to meet challenges faced by SIDS in the energy, water, wastewater, and solid waste sectors • Infrastructure strategies that are aligned with SDG and Paris Agreement targets are more cost-effective in the long-term Abstract Small island developing states face particular challenges to ensure their infrastructure promotes social, economic, and environmental well-being. Closing the achievement gap for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) involves prioritisation and coordination across multiple sectors. With an application to the country of Saint Lucia, this paper develops a stakeholder-driven analysis framework integrating four interdependent infrastructure sectors (electricity, water, wastewater, solid waste). Drawing on extensive consultation with decision-makers in-country-134 stakeholders from 18 government ministries, agencies, academia, or the private sector-the analysis identifies specific interventions that could be implemented over the next decades to meet future needs for sustainable infrastructure services. These interventions are congruent with the government's development plans. Long-term, cross-sectoral portfolios of investments and policies ('strategies') are developed which demonstrably reach the targets of the SDGs and Saint Lucia's emissions reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement. The sequencing of these investments or policies is designed to optimise their efficiency and impact over time, identifying "quick wins" while ensuring that there is sufficient action to provide services in the long term sustainably. A comparison of costs associated with each strategy suggests that accounting for interdependencies and taking a long-term perspective can save costs over the life of infrastructure investments. This process of infrastructure assessment is applicable beyond the small island context, allowing practitioners a means to undertake systematic assessment of a country's future infrastructure needs and to develop appropriate solutions aligned with its national objectives and international commitments.},

These systems have evolved over centuries, being planned and implemented piecewise, and mostly managed in isolation from one-another. The growing interconnection between these systems and the convergent challenges ahead (i.e. demographic, technological, and climate change) call for an integrated “systems-of-systems” approach to managing national infrastructure. Here we propose a modeling framework for the long-term (to 2100) simulation of national infrastructure (NI) system performance in a highly uncertain future. The approach is based upon the assessment of performance of infrastructure services in a wide range of possible future conditions, and a robust optimization to identify cross- sectoral strategies that ensure satisfactory infrastructure performance.

We asked 14 experts to describe probable and preferable futures using a quantitative questionnaire and qualitative interviews. Wind power production grows in all scenarios but there were differences in the order of magnitude of 10. The growth rate of electricity consumption slows down in all scenarios. Qualitative arguments varied even within clusters, with wind power policy emerging as the main dividing factor. The differences revealed diverse values and political objectives, as well as great uncertainties in assumptions about future developments. These influence wind power policy and were also believed to have contributed to the slow development of wind power in Finland. Re-thinking of the Finnish wind power policy is recommended. The 'soft' scenario method is considered valuable in finding diverse views, constructing transparent scenarios and assisting energy policy making. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The occupied Palestinian territories of West Bank and Gaza Strip are currently experiencing many challenges in the provision of infrastructure services for their inhabitants. This includes an undersupply of infrastructure services across multiple sectors – an issue exacerbated by population growth, increasing urbanisation, economic growth and climate change. We address this challenge by providing a systems-based assessment of Palestine's infrastructure requirements and identifying broad strategies for how those needs might be met. This assessment involved four key components including: 1) defining and assessing the current system and planned infrastructure investments; 2) assessing potential future demand for infrastructure services; 3) identifying alternative strategies for future infrastructure provision beyond planned investments; and 4) analysing the performance of each strategy against a series of key performance indicators. Results from the assessment highlight the magnitude of the current and future need for urgent infrastructure investment in Palestine. The most immediate need is to alleviate the water crises in Gaza Strip, which will require at least twice as much water infrastructure investment over the coming decade than is currently in the pipeline, even if the goal is only to achieve the most basic World Health Organisation water availability requirements. To move beyond this protracted state of crises will then require a doubling of investments across all sectors to bring Palestine up to the standards of services already enjoyed by its neighbours. Such investments can have even greater impact on delivery of infrastructure services through the strategic use of interdependencies between infrastructure sectors, such as water re-use and energy-from-waste. In the pursuit of global sustainable development, the systems-based approach presented here provides an important first step in the assessment of infrastructure needs and opportunities for any country. It is particularly important for states like Palestine where key resources, such as water and energy, are so acutely constrained.},
